Our waiter recommended a banana tots appetizer to share. For dinner, the paella with jasmine rice, and a mixed-bean dish both provided the sustenance we were looking for.",

The paella was a bit too mushy, for example.

I came here with my dad after walking by many a times in Rice Village, and we finally made it in there to try, and it was well worth it. I now take all of my friends and family who visit there and we enjoy in the tasty food. The waiter service is superb. My water glass would be filled almost after every other sip, now that's service. The paella de la tierra, paella of the land, since I don't eat seafood, was wonderful. It is a huge dish so I suggest sharing and taking it home for some yummy leftovers. Also the goat cheese with tomato sauce, is so rich and creamy and served with the garlic bread, I could eat that alone and be a happy camper. The rest of the food is great, and in perfect sizes and prices to try anything. I reccomend this restaurant to anyone who likes to eat and have a wonderful time dining. Also if it is a gorgeous day, sitting outside is so delightful, you almost feel like you're not in Houston for a while.",

There are different cookies, but I think classic chocolate chip is still the best. The cookie is so warm that ice cream just melts. Even though you want to take your time and savor it, you have to speed up the bites so it's not one melted mess. My favorite part is the last bottom chocolate bits still stuck on the pan just like getting those last bits from a paella pan. It has a crunch as concentrated sweetness that will give you a good sugar rush. I tried eating a whole one myselft. It was difficult but possible. However, I'm better off just sharing and making sure I get the most.\n \nThis BJ's has good energy especially during play off season. The staff is friendly, and it's a good place to get good food for a reasonable price in Westwood.",
