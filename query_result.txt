It doesn't serve up the best hot dog you'll ever have, but they have a solid dog menu.  \n\nThe menu is mainly based around the chili cheese dog, which comes with american cheese, mustard, and Varsity brand chili.  The chili is decent and meaty, but not very spicy.  You could say the chili doesn't take anything away from the hot dog, but without some spice or strong flavor, the chili isn't adding much either.  Instead, it's the combo of the mustard and the chili that sells the hot dog.  The american cheese slice was tucked into the bun and didn't really melt into the chili--that's the main negative I have for the dog.  The cheese mostly remained separate from the chili and didn't add anything to the mix.\n\nIf you're a coleslaw fan, try a chili slaw dog.  I had a \"slaw dog\" -- simply a hot dog with coleslaw on it.  The coleslaw itself was diced and lightly sweetened.  It wasn't bad, but wasn't particularly remarkable as a slaw.  So I'd recommend ordering a chili dog with slaw so that you're not relying on the slaw alone for flavor.\n\nOnion rings were super greasy, but flaky.  The fried coating was thick and smooth and left a light grease stain on everything it touched.\n\nThe Varsity's been around for a long time and has lots of traditions for visitors to experience/read about.  The most prominent tradition is that the staff greets customers with the customary \"What'ch y'all want\".  Given it's history and decent tasting dogs, this place is worth a visit.\n\nBottom line: 3 1/2 stars for the food.  Add in 1/2 a star for the tradition (it is the South after all).",

The BFT visits his favorite college food establishments on and around Telegraph Ave.  The tour is best enjoyed with another person, in order to share food items and maximize the number of places to eat!\n\nWe usually get a Hot Link and cut it in half; the hubster puts onions and ketchup on his half, while I eat mine with just ketchup.  The Hot Link is an apt description, because it's nice and spicy. The grilled bun takes the hot dog to another level.  Just writing this review is making me crave one!\n\nThe people who work here are definitely characters, sometimes you get a guy who is super-friendly and jovial, and sometimes you get a guy who is all business and yells at the customers to not crowd the doorways.\n\nSpeaking of crowding the doorways, the shop is so small, it's almost impossible to not crowd the doorway.  But the crowding isn't a problem, as the newspaper clippings and cartoons on the wall make the wait bearable.  In the end, getting the dog makes it all worthwhile. :)\n\nOne thing to note is that you can get the dogs to take home and grill, generally 6 dogs and 6 buns for $6. Grilling and eating the hot dog at home is not quite the same experience as eating in Berkeley, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do!",

Today they had a chicken mango habanero dog....wow!!!!\n\nThis place is tiny! There isn't enough room for all the cool stuff they put on the walls of the other location.

Skinless beef weiners and hawaiian sweet bread rolls....What little resemblance it has to the hot dog is just deceiving. Cuz it tastes NOTHING like it! \n\nI got the Sooo Cali and the bf got the Best of the Wurst, with sauerkraut and spicy peppers. I don't remember what sausage he got. But his came in a french roll instead of hawaiian rolls. I didn't try his so I guess it's irrelevant to this review, but it looked damn good. We also got their onion rings on the side as well. Luckily, we beat the dinner rush so were able to order and get our foods right away.\n\nAnyways, back to my Sooo Cali....their description for it is \"mixed greens, diced tomato, tempura fried onions, spicy basil aioli, avocado.\" I'd like to describe it as mouthfuls of heaven. It was SOOOO goooddddddd. And so huge! I had to stretch my mouth prettyyy wide to shove that thing in. Course that got tiring so I developed a 2 bite method - a bite of the toppings and then a second bite of the dog itself, and let it all mix in your mouth. Oh gawd it was so good. I don't know how they came up with the combination, but it's magical! I really appreciate that they have such an option with a nice serving of veggies in it, for veggie lovers like me. The spicy basil aioli btw....if they will sell me a keg of that stuff, I think I can eat it with just about anything. \n\nI'm sad that this is in Pasadena and so far away from me...I'm going to have to suck it up and make more frequent trips out here I guess =P.",

I would have engaged in a lot more mischievous hijinks as a kid if I had known that my only potential punishment was a mouth-watering, juicy sausage, smothered in grilled onions and jalapeno peppers, layered up with dijon mustard and curry ketchup, and placed gently on a crispy, sweet french roll.  So for this week's grubbing session we knocked over a few mailboxes and spray-painted the cat blue ... and landed ourselves in Pasadena's Dog Haus. \n\nThe place has a cool, open, classed-up vibe with long wood tables, a cart loaded up with hot dog fixins, and a giant menu board tempting you with a cornucopia of devilishly creative hot dog and sausage concoctions.  Our grub mate H. Dawg, went for the Sooo Cali topped with mixed greens, diced tomatoes, crispy tempura fried onion strips, a spicy basil aioli, and avocado all loaded into a few soft squares of King's Hawaiian bread.  If you've never had the super-soft Hawaiian delight ... or never had a hot dog on it for that matter ... you've never really lived. \n\nOurselves, we battled back and forth ... resisting the desire to dive into one of their out-of-control (in a good way) hot dogs that are loaded up with toppings such as thick (and we mean thick ... like \"measure it with a ruler\" thick) sliced bacon, eggs, and tatter tots ... or another with chili-con-carne and a sprinkle of Fritos chips.  Eventually we landed on one of the house specials ... the \"Best of the Wurst\" ... we went with the bratwurst and loaded up the aforementioned grilled onions and jalapeno peppers.  Everything was taste-tastic ... from the flavor packed brat to the soaking-up-the-juices, just a-little-bit-of-sweetness and a-little-bit-of-crunch french roll. \n\nTo match up with our dogs, we went with an order of their super sized onion rings and the side dish of every 11 year old's dreams ... tater tots.  Now I know why Napoleon saved 'em up in his cargos pockets and was hesitant to give them away.  These crispy, salty, cylindrical morsels of grub-delight are a magical accompaniment to any meal ... a perfect device to dunk into that craving-inducing curry ketchup (seriously ... if they don't have it out on the fixins cart ... ask for it) and pop into your soon-to-be-dancing mouth. \n\nOf course we also added a bottle of Mexican Coke to our order.  Some say the deliciousness comes from the real sugar instead of corn syrup ... others firmly believe it's the glass bottle that makes it so damn good.  But deep down we all know the real reason ... unicorn powder.  Whatever it is, we just love the stuff ... especially when you're matching it up with the gut-busting, mind-blowing, heaven-on-a-bun coming out of the Dog Haus.  Each bite I felt myself channeling my inner Sean Connery and holding back the desire to shout out \"You're the man now dog!\"  But it's true ... and honestly Dog Haus, that's really the only way to describe it.  You are ... simply ... the man.",

They had high tables (some low ones) with bar stools...which was a problem for me because I came in with a hunger-induced stomach ache and was really hankering for a chair with a back for me to lean on and ease my pain.

If I had a penny for every time I was there drunk or sober, I'd give Trump a run for his money.  You go to the \"O\" with friends.  Never by yourself.  Now granted it's been 15 years and with the price of inflation, I can remember spending $1.50 on a great hot dog.  This hot dog had some snap to it.  Also, a large pizza cost $5.  You can go here for less than $5 a person and feed the cast of Entourage, including all of Vincent Chase's women.  I miss this place like there is no tomorrow.  My arteries will always be aching for The \"O\".",

                    "text": "The negative reviews are totally clueless.  First, the chili dogs are the benchmark for all chili dogs.  \"Bad  chili,\" some yokel says.  OF COURSE, on it's own, but it's not supposed to be chili ON ITS OWN.  Most chili dogs are a competition between the hot dog and the chili, with the chili (usually with stupid beans) drowning the dog so you can't eat it without knife and fork.  The Varsity chili dog is a perfect balance between the bun, the dog, the chili and the mustard (and the optional fresh onions) -- and easy to fondle.  The rings and the fried pies are best-in-class.  But by nature they don't travel well.  If you order them to go, they WILL go limp or the crust soft by the time you get home.\n\nAnd that brings me to freshness.  EVERYTHING is fresh.  The Varsity invented \"just-in-time\" long before McDonald's.\n\nAlso, the other sandwiches....  Grow up and try the \"chili steak\" (chili burger to the newbies).  The others -- ham and swiss on rye, pimento, or house chicken salad -- are unique and delicious.\n\nThe frosted orange (NOT \"frozen\" orange) is a trademark milkshake.  The basis was an old non-carbonated soft drink called Bireley's and vanilla ice cream.  They used to make it from scratch but it now comes out like a hard slush.  Not as good today, but still a must for a Varsity pig-out.\n\nAs for prices, don't be ridiculous!  First, they sit on prime downtown real estate; second, business taxes in Atlanta are SKY-HIGH to cover the asses of the corrupt and incompetent city government.  Believe me, they don't wanna charge so much, but they have to.  So, think before you rant.\n\nSorry, Varsity trashers -- the problem isn't the Big V, it's you.  If you don't like The Varsity, then you're not an Atlantan.  Go away.",

We've traveled back in time and now are in the Southern quadrant of Los Angeles, in a public space referred to by the inhabitants as the California Science Center.  We have been asked by the Federation to investigate the Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination exhibit (February 11 to April 29, 2007).  Our scanners indicate that this exhibit combines costumes and props from all six Star Wars films with real-world technologies, video interviews with filmmakers, scientists and engineers.  We detect two large Engineering Design Labs, where one can build and test speeders and robots. \n\nOn our beam down, we explored prototypes of Earth's technology, learned about the planet's engineers and designers who are creating new technologies, and discover intriguing similarities between how their scientists and filmmakers think.  We also discovered a workshop and learned how to create some of our favorite Star Wars characters and vehicles using origami (unfortunately, this event was only on the afternoon that investigated, but here's a website with more information http://www.starwarsorigami.com/).  The tricorder readings were off the chart - geek factor: 100!!!\n\nWe split up into two teams.  One investigated the Star Wars exhibit while the other watched a 3-D film about creatures that existed on Unfortunately, we lost one of our crew members from the reconnaissance party (Ensign Jones, the one wearing the red shirt) as he was attacked by a mysterious life form consisting of a yellow gelatinous substance near the concessions stand at the IMAX theater.  The remains of a hot dog was also nearby.  A subsequent tricorder reading indicated that the yellow substance was from the nachos.  And the hot dog?  Well that was just plain inedible.  We are running further tests on both to determine the cause of death, but clearly it could have been from his ingestion of either item.\n\nOur recommendation is that this exhibit be further explored and we will be sending down further Starship Enterprise crew members in the upcoming two (2) weeks while the exhibit is still open.  They will be briefed as to the nachos and hot dog threat.\n\nLive long and prosper.  Kirk out.\n\n[BTW, in case anyone wants to debate the use of a Star Trek format in a Star Wars-related review, they can contact me at:\n\nbiteme@ireallydonotgiveacrap.com\n\nOh yeah, more info can be found at www.californiasciencecenter.org .]",

It was a quiet and chilly Sunday afternoon in Pasadena and we quickly found a place in their outdoor sitting area that was nice and comfortable thanks to the overhead heaters that were on.\n\nAfter a quick survey of their ample selection of eats, we ordered and waited no more than 10 minutes for our food to arrive.\n\nWhat made the exchange pleasant was the staff. Both the gentlemen behind the front counter where friendly and took the time to discuss a little football with me. It was a fun back-and-forth and I appreciated their openness. \n\nOnce the food arrived we dug right in.\n\nThe hot dogs were splendid and I hungrily tore in on the Double Dare selection. I enjoyed the view of a liberal helping of Jalapenos on the dog and I have to admit being somewhat intimidated by the potential find. Interestingly enough, the heat was challenging but not overwhelming and it helped me appreciate every bite thoroughly.\n\nOur only disappointment came with the order of cheese fries. They didn't seem to have a great deal of seasoning and the cheese cooled quickly and simply sat a top instead of grabbing onto each potato strip. We may have done better by ordering a side of ranch and/or blue cheese.\n\nNonetheless, the experience at the Dog Haus was fun and worth while and I recommend the place.",

The last store use to be Sumo burger.\n\nAnyways...I can see why they don't get that many customers, but I feel like they should have more.  \n\nYou can get a chicken teriyaki bowl for $5.17 with tax here.  I think it's a good deal, but I feel like it can be cheaper haha.  It's pretty good.  They give you fresh veggies (carrots and broccoli), pretty good amount of chicken (most of the fat is taken off), and a whole lot of rice (I never finish it unless I didn't eat the whole day).  If you want something with more spices then you can get another bowl that has a different sauce called the Thai BBQ.  I also had their burgers which aren't bad.\n\nThey also have a happy hour from 3pm to 6pm?   Little snacks for like 2 bucks.  I never  ordered from it.  Sounds like crap.  Fries and hot dog (I rather go to Desi dog) and chicken nuggets and fries (????) UMMM NO!  \n\nFor the most part they are quick and sweet.  The seating is very comfortable and relaxing and you never have to worry about finding a seat like other places.  Also, close to campus so my feet and stomach are happy.  They have a big screen TV which is a plus in my book.  They always have some movie playing and it's a nice way for me to not worry about studying hahah even though I really don't do that anyways  :x\n\nThey have a frequent buyers card too.  So ask them for one, if they don't mention it.  Currently, after you purchase a meal they give you a 15% coupon.  How much better is that?  An extra quarter for you to keep to put towards yopo.

Walked in and the host said it would be about 15-20 minute wait. There were 3 other parties before us. After they were seated it was just us waiting. Another couple comes in and they were immediately seated. The host also had the personality of a door knob. On the other hand our waitress was great. \n\nThe music is always a bit loud, but this time it was very very loud. The clientele also seems to have changed. There were a couple tables nearby where the customers were basically screaming and laughing. One woman even got up to show off her karate kick a few times. \n\nSince I wasn't hungry for a burger I was going to order the fish and chips, which are (were) always delicious. Unfortunately they no longer offer it. I didn't want a wrap, hot dog or a salad, so I decided to go with the patty melt. Unfortunately that is also no longer offered (unless you want turkey or veggie), so I just ordered the regular burger with fries. It was tasty but nothing special. The fries were lukewarm at best. \n\nI don't think we'll be going back. I also think the Vortex could care less if they lost a customer.",

                    "text": "I have mixed feelings about this place. I've been in 2x's (more if we count, when it was called Matt's Gourmet Hot Dogs\"). The first time there was a nice and presumably thai woman behind the counter. I ordered the cheese quesadilla, and my fiance ordered the veggie dog. I tried his, and it was so-so, exactly what you would get for a couple bucks. The quesadilla was pretty good, I have to say. At least for 3.99 it was. I decided to go again tonight and was a little weirded out that the guy that was ALWAYS working there when it was Matt's Hot Dogs was still working there under the new ownership. I wondered if my experience would not be as good as the last time, because I'm not too sure he gives a damn about the place. I felt bad about coming in at 6:30 because of his behavior towards me. I ordered one of the bowls, and thought it sounded good. MY MISTAKE. The bowl (which was not the chili bowl), was almost entirely chili and raw onions, with a few specks of rice and cheese that was very difficult to stir. I asked him if they were closing and he said an hour, so I tipped him a dollar but man this was just a terrible wast of money. I know I only payed 2.50 for the meal, but I would have rather of gone to pagliacci's and gotten something that I know is going to be good, no matter who is working. Try to go in, if the woman is working, it's not regrettable and won' give you indigestion.",

They've got a limited menu of topped burgers named after Boston area sports stars. They also do their own smoothies/frappes, which are thick and sweet. I had their hot dog with the works last night, and it was quite good. They also have grilled and fried chicken sandwiches.\n\nThey cook up your food to order, so it takes a few minutes. UBurger is right in the midst of Kenmore Square, so it gets pretty busy. It's a fairly small place, so kinda hard to sit during peak hours. There's also pretty limited parking around there, especially during the day.\n\nThe burgers are typically juicy and good in all varieties, and will run you about $6-7; combos are about $2 more. In my experience, the thin, almost shoestring fries are the best side; the onion rings are the skinny, stringy kind with little flavor. The shakes are good, just expensive.",

There's a decent selection of beer on draft (Peroni!), and last time I ordered some fruity martini and was actually impressed with its tartness - not bad. I've also done many, many Irish car bombs at this joint.\n \nThree stars because I am not a fan of this joint as a lunch spot - most of the menu is just too heavy (read: fried) for lunch unless you want to snooze your way through the afternoon back at the office, and I'm not a fan of the salad selections. Apparently they are revising their menu for the summer, so I'll have to check it out, but I'm thrilled that we're getting some new lunch spots on Crescent (check out Noon Midtown!).",

How do I know that?  It was on the sign!!!\n\nThe setting reminds me of something straight out of the 70s.  Dark panel walls with matching booths.  I don't mind that as long as the food is good.  Being from the midwest it's kinda welcoming.  With all the panelling, there's still a lot of natural light so it's not cave-ish or anything.  \n\nThe line to order's almost out the door and it moved pretty quick.  The menu's on the backwall above the register and I notice that the sandwiches were pretty pricey ($7.79 each).  So my husband got the pastrami and I got the roast beef au jus.  With that we got a small fries and a small soft drink and a cup for water and our bill was almost $22. \n\nGot our food pretty quick and the fries, even though, they were a size small came in a brown paper bag and was almost half full.  There were plenty of fries and they were actually pretty good, but needless to say, both of us couldn't eat it all.  Apparently, you can top your fries with their gravy or chili but being first timers here, we just wanted the basics.  The sandwiches had the soft bread with the meat in it (his pastrami and mine roast beef) and that's it.  I got the au jus with my roast beef and that came in a covered cup.  The roast beef was soft and good, but the au jus tasted like watery soy sauce.  It was a tad salty and made the sandwich wet.  If that's all you want for your jus, it did the job.  I kept thinking something was missing.  I guess I shouldn't compare it to the same sandwiches in Chicago where there were cheese and peppers in there but I wanted to try it in its intended form but had to get extra peppers from the counter but, alas, no cheese in sight.  The pastrami was alright too.  Nothing extra-ordinary and my husband actually liked my roast beef more than his pastrami. \n\n I miss food like this when we travelled through Chicago and New York.  Full of flavors and came with everything on it.  There was hot dog on the menu too.  I was wondering what they put on the hot dogs here when you order one since all the condoments were in tiny packets on the front counter and not like those Chicago style hot dogs that once you ordered a dog, you would also get the pickles, relish, mustard, onions, tomatoes, ketchup handed to you and, of course, extra cheese to go with your fries as well.\n\nGlad I tried it and have checked it off my list.  Kinda pricey so probably wont be back any time in the near future.",

Honestly, one of the best hotel stays I've ever experienced. \n\nThe room:\nTotally comfy, not huge (but decent-sized), great shower & bathroom, the bed was really comfortable (I'm even overlooking the fact that the sheets wouldn't stay on [weren't sized correctly it seems] because that wasn't a huge issue), great quality linens and towels, etc. No complaints minus the sheet thing, which yes.. They should fix, but it was SO minor compared with how great everything else was.\n\nThe hotel: Beautiful interior, great historic building (I think?), really nice location in downtown Providence, DOG FRIENDLY (super dog friendly), and the hotel also provided a really nice location for the wedding reception & cocktail hour we attended. At the reception they were willing to make my husband and me (the only vegetarians there, apparently) a vegetarian dish that wasn't on the menu. (As a side note, the hotel's restaurant isn't very vegetarian-friendly, but that doesn't matter much because the hotel is super close to restaurants with great vegetarian options.)\n\nThe service: FABULOUS. Great people work here for sure. Never had any complaints about any of the staff. The people at the front desk were always nice and accommodating to my many questions, and one of the girls there brought out two large boxes of great doggie treats for our pups! I was floored! The maid on our floor was always so nice to our dogs & to us. We ordered \"continental breakfast\" one morning from the hotel's restaurant, and it arrived promptly the next morning and was SO delicious! I figured it wouldn't be much food, but it was a huge tray filled with pastries, muffins, a huge fruit plate, a large orange juice, a whole thermos pitcher of hot chocolate, etc. A great deal, in my opinion! \n\nHonestly, writing this review makes me wish I was back there. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Providence, and I'm so glad our friends had blocked rooms at this hotel for their wedding. Thanks, guys! Highly recommend the Hotel Providence!!",

Careful, the first bite is squirty.  Ew, what a gross word.  \n\nStep Three: browse free range local meats raised in Lancaster county by the very people standing very quietly behind the counter.  Order, pay a fraction of what you would at Costco for a chicken that mainlined roids  and squawked from sunup to sundown in close quarters with other juiced up, squawking chickens.  \n\nStep Four: taste local farm raised cheeses and/or cream cheese spreads on free crackers.  Um, the cheese is also free.  Also they have chocolate milk.  \n\nStep Five: CANDY.  \n\nStep Six: Poultry.  One time my boyfriend and I bought an entire duck with the intention of also purchasing sweet potato fries (we'll get there) and eating in the orange booths (we'll get there).  But then we found out they closed in five minutes and we had to rush to a Five Guys for fries, and a wine shop for something to drink and THEN a college park to eat at a picnic table, brown bag our wine and chow down on delicious, fatty duck in the rapidly darkening sky.  Me and my catastrophic dates.\n\nStep Seven: produce (not too much of a selection) and then homemade salads, crabcakes, deli items, and jarred things like spiced pears and jam.  Also on your left, notice the beautiful (expensive) carpentry.  \n\nStep Eight:  short order counter, row of orange booths.  Dirt cheap sweet potato fries, slow cooked bbq pulled pork sandwiches.  Is it every first Saturday or every last they have a pig roast there.  If you're into that sort of thing.  \n\nStep Nine:  thank me later.",

It's something I missed and there isn't anything close to it around these parts. They have a wide selection of buns, some on the smaller side and most of a usual size. The coconut cream bun was soft and perfect, but gets stale quickly so eat it immediately after purchase. There are also hot dog and green onion buns, which is a favorite of mine. There's also a tuna bun that I've never had before, but liked. They also have minced meat puff pastry pies, which I like. They also have those cake rolls. I bet they'll also have lots of people buying their full sized cakes for birthday occasions. There are only a few, but they look presentable and are a decent price if you live nearby and don't want to make the trek elsewhere. They have smaller cakes and some cake slices too at reasonable prices of $2 to $4. I was also surprised to find that they have macarons. They're $1.25. They're a reasonable size, but light and hollow. I'm not sure what the drinks are like here, but they serve Peerless Coffee. Also, staff needs to be more careful when handling the goods. One of my buns was dropped onto the counter when being rung up, but I took it anyway because it would be a shame for it to be thrown away.\n\nI'm not sure how well this place will do once Sheng Kee opens up on Telegraph.",

Recommended by a friend, definitely best sausage I've had (that's what she said)\n\nLong story long:\n\nAfter my pseudo-failure of a mini hike on the Cal campus in an attempt to get up to Lawrence Lab, the walk had more or less worked off lunch at Angeline's and I needed an afternoon snack.  I had this on my list of places in Berkeley to check out, so I made a B-line for the place.\n\nThis place is practically a little shack.  A small counter, a condiment station, and that's pretty much it.  I wonder what this place is like when it's packed with 8-10 people.  Yeah, it's that small. *that's what she said*\n\nI got the bockwurst.  All of the sausages cost 3 dollars.  I was thinking of getting 2, but considering I was going to have Chez Panisse later that night, I didn't want to fill myself up too much.  In fact, I was tempted to go to Fat Slice but didn't.  After a couple minutes reheating the sucker, I paid and he gave me my sausage in a french roll and wrapped in parchment paper.  I turn around (remember I told you how small this place is) and load up some onions, relish, and sauerkraut.  I take 2 steps to the far counter and pulled out my camera to get a few shots.\n\nI dug in and it was really good.  All of the sausage and that's what she said jokes aside, this was probably the best hot dog/sausage I've ever had.  Definitely worth the $3.\n\nwait for it....\n\nthat's what she said....",

                    "text": "I love the movies. Yes, there is Netflix, yes, there are DVD's, yes, there is Hulu and other online things but nothing beats the experience of seeing a movie on a big screen and sitting amongst your peers and being able to escape your ordinary life for the fantasy of an action adventure, a drama or a cartoon. You can't replace the theatre experience with these other mediums because they just don't compare. \n\nWell, if you go to the movies a lot like me, you appreciate the REGENCY's of the world who offer discount movies. Yes, I will pay the big bucks of the ARCLIGHT but I can't do that all the time. Sometimes the pocketbook needs a break!  Cuz, those $17 food combo's at the AMC or the Pacific's can hurt a girl's bottom line. \n\nIf you are like me, you go to the \"must sees\" first and you save those \"I kinda want to see it but it may suck\" movies for the second run realm. That is where REGENCY comes in for me. \n\nI am a fan because not only do they have the best bargin in town with  $2 matinees and $3 evening shows but they got the best hot dog price in the world (watch out Ikea!)  \n\nNow when you come to the Regency you are not going to get assigned seats, you are not going to get stadium seating and you are not going to get the best sound system in the world.  However,  you are going to get that old school charm, that good pricing and most of all, you are going to get that big screen experience that movies just require. In fact, if you are a buff like me, you are going to get chills on your arms when you hear the roar of the projector coming from the booth.  \n\nSo get your second run on at Regency in Pasadena and support the big screen experience.   You can totally have a date night for a grand total of $10 bucks.  How sweet is that?  Pretty sweet in my book.",

                    "text": "The Vortex makes a pretty mean burger.  Vortex Midtown was the first legit burger establishment I ate at when I first moved to Atlanta over 10 years ago, mainly due to it's proximity to Tech.  I still live nearby and over the years, this restaurant has proven to be a reliable standby for solid bar food.  They have a patio right on Peachtree, which makes it perfect for people watching.  And they're open late, most days until 2 to 3am.\n\nThe menu has over 20 different burger varieties and all sorts of delicious apps, such as their nacho tots.  My favorites include the aforementioned tots, sweet potato fries, fried zucchini slices, mini corn dogs, Vortex Bacon Cheeseburger, Tasmanian Devil Burger, Cowboy Burger, and the Big Nine-Inch Weenie.\n\nThe nacho tots are a messy conglomeration of tots, chili, shredded cheese, olives, lettuce, sour cream, and salsa.  It's good, and great for groups.  You can get it with regular nachos too, but the tots are better.  Vortex's sweet potato fries are among the best in the city.  They are crinkle-cut and served hot from the fryer.\n\nThe burgers are huge.  These ain't no FLIP or YEAH! burgers.  The sirloin patties are large, thick, and hearty.  Each burger comes with lettuce, sweet red onion, and tomato, a slice of pickle, and a side (fries, onion rings, chips, etc.).  And yes, you can get sweet potato fries as a side.  The Tasmanian Devil Burger comes with pepperberry rub, pepperjack cheese, and pineapple salsa.  The Cowboy Burger comes with grilled ham, jack cheese, and spicy honey BBQ sauce.  I haven't had a burger here that I didn't like except for the Black & Blue Burger (too much blue cheese for me).\n\nThe Big Nine-Inch Weenie is solid.  It's plump, thick, and all-beef.  Great flavor and consistency and very satisfying.  It's a big, filling hot dog.  I usually load mine up with coleslaw, raw onion, and sweet relish (no additional cost).  Other topping options include sauerkraut and sauteed onions.\n\nService is generally very good and the servers are friendly.  One of my favorite servers has been Elizabeth D. (pro-active, straight-laced, and good sense of humor). The atmosphere is a combination of bikers, skeletons, tattoos, and piercings.  Laughing Skull Lounge, a comedy club, is also located inside the restaurant.  You can read my review for the LSL here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/laughing-skull-lounge-atlanta#hrid:QrTygG6fzlDtLdnHyiBXzw.  Vortex does have an 18 and up age policy, which I like because you don't have a bunch of little kids running around making noise.\n\nMidtown Vortex is located caddy corner from the Starbucks on Peachtree.  There are several pay lots, parking decks, and street parking spots available close-by.  I recommend parking in the AmeriPark surface lot directly across the street ($5).",

The walls are so thin. I lived there for 7 months and 4 months I had no neighbors on either side or above. I was on the second story. They charges for everything. At first everything was great. Then the manager started complaining about my dog barking and scaring people in my building. The only problem was that my dog went to work with me so he was not their during the day. Once management knew that then all of sudden I stopped getting calls. I was charged for a parking sticker, security to drive through, and a door opener. At least once a month the garage door would break and it even blew up one time. The power was always going out and not coming on for days. When I moved out the manager came into my apartment and went to specific spots looking for dog pee. Every spot that she pulled the carpet up at there was pee staining. My dog was never allowed in the bedroom or bathroom but that where she went looking. I was told that women before me had many dogs. I think it is a scam.",

                    "text": "Cuatro's is a great new contender in the casual-yet-upscale, patio-dining category.  Started by a crew of former Chuy's/Hula Hut/Shady Grove managers, Cuatro's kicks the food up about 10 notches from this chain and serves it in a much more modern, less touristy setting.  The result is pretty darn delightful.\n\nI had the shrimp and avocado tacos, which were terrific.  The shrimp was perfectly grilled and there was a generous portion of avocado.  It sported Cuatro's \"ubiquitous sauce\" (their name, not mine), which is a surprising mix of sriracha (or \"hot cock,\" as Yelper Delicious L. so aptly calls it), mayonnaise, salt and pepper.  The tortillas were nicely warmed and tasted very fresh.  The only thing that would have made it better was a little cabbage; I like the slight crunch and bitterness that cabbage adds to seafood tacos.  Two tacos a la carte ran me just $7.\n\nCuatro's also offers a pretty extensive selection of burgers, several other types of tacos (including a number of veggie options), and a few salads.  Sides appear to be extra for all dishes, but their pricing is sufficiently low to make that OK.  I did notice that they offer my weakness, sweet potato fries; I'll have to try those sometime when I'm feeling a little more splurge-y.\n\nThey have a pretty good selection of draft beers (plus my fave draft cider, Woodchuck Amber) and a full bar, so mixed drinks are an option, as well.  There are drink specials every night of the week.  The night I was here (Wed), they had $3 premium pints and $1.50 pints of the usual suspect domestics (Miller, Miller Lite, etc.).  Fridays, they have happy hour from 3 pm until close!  I don't remember all the Friday happy hour deals, but I do remember that it included $2 well drinks.  Now that's my kind of happy.\n\nGreat service, nice open patio that's dog friendly (yeah!), a little bit of free parking (key in West Campus), and reasonable prices.  The only thing I might suggest is that you avoid this place on big game days, as they have quite a few high def TV's and a giant projection TV right out front.\n\nAt first blush, Cuatro's rates a high four stars from me.  I'd give 'em 4-1/2 if I could.  I need at least one or two more visits to convince me to bump them up to the coveted five-star rating, but that's a distinct possibility.  Cuatro's is definitely worth a visit - check it out!\n\n------\nEDIT, 5/9/08:  Was back here for lunch with other Yelpers in tow.  Cuatro's didn't deliver quite as well as it had on my first visit.  Service was a little scattered (it was much more crowded), and the food wasn't as fabulous.  I tried the portabello burger, and it was really drippy - I had to give up about halfway through and eat it with a fork and knife.  We tried the sweet potato fries, which I liked fine, but I think I may have been the only one.  Since Don P. was there, we also had to have queso (of course), which was all right, but not amazing.  It was better when eaten with the salsa we requested to have with it.  My favorite part about this meal (other than the company) was the jalapeno ranch dressing, which was very homemade tasting and had a great zing.  I wanted to dip EVERYTHING in it.\n\nStill a four-star experience, but not the \"OMG this may be my new place\" four-plus star experience I had the first time around.  Nevertheless, I'm sure I'll be back, especially during those wonderful Austin patio-weather days.",

The lamb was beautifully seasoned and very good. \n\nI would definitely come back if I am ever in the area.",

Just good and reasonably priced, and that's more than you can say for every place.\n\nSo go with a group, especially if it includes some vegetarians or some people who might not be up for anything too innovative.

That sucks, and I boycotted this place for awhile, but I have gone back a couple times recently because I craved it. I don't really like supporting them, but then I got to thinking, there are lots of corporations that we all support that probably do pretty messed up things.

I went to Fat Matt's, had a bunch of ribs, then went to The Varsity and tried to put away a chili dog. I succeeded because that is how I roll.**\n\nThis place is definitely an experience. First of all, being from the Bay Area, it's a cultural experience. I'll just put that out there. This is a historical landmark, in many ways, as a long standing local food chain with a lot of history in Atlanta. I liked the school theme with the desks as tables and all of the sports-themed memorabilia.\n\nThe food is CHEAP. I mean compared to what you're always paying in the Bay. And that's great. By cheap, I'm saying you can get a chili cheese dog, a small orange shake and fries for LESS THAN SEVEN DOLLARS. There is NO way in hell SF would let you get away with that. Well actually they wouldn't let you get away with chili cheese anything... unless it's vegan tofu chili. Blech.\n\nThe funniest part is ordering. If you've ever seen the episode of the Conan O'Brien Show where Jack Brayer and Triumph the Insult Dog visit the Chicago Weiner Circle, it's like way less offensive than that but kiiiiiiind of close. All I'll say is you better know what you want before you get up there otherwise they will roll their eyes at you until the end of time.\n\nLove it, no less. I want to go back.",

In order to make a fair comparison, I ordered the same thing- a pulled pork sandwich. The sauce itself was ok- a little sweet, but unfortunately I couldn't taste the pork. My sandwich consisted of bun + BBQ sauce with almost NO meat. The sauce was so overwhelming, and the lack of protein so significant that you almost couldn't tell if you were eating pulled pork or brisket. It tasted exactly like my mother-in-law's shredded BBQ beef made in the crock pot...Which is fine, for a crock pot dinner, but if your whole restaurant is BBQ- you should make something better than anyone could make by sticking a pork butt in the crock pot, covering w/ BBQ sauce and walking away for 8 hours. The mac and cheese was also meh- it tasted like Stouffer's frozen with salt and paprika sprinkled on top.\n\nIf you want great BBQ, skip Blues and Hickory River, head to Black Dog in Urbana!",

Not because it was so good but because i needed to try my dog a few ways before i wrote my review. The first time i went classic and i ordered a #1 with onion rings and a side of chili. I had some big expectations for this place since everyone ive asked would say how great this place was. I thought one of my coworkers was going to start tearing up when i mentioned this place. He said he had being going to The varsity for over 30 years and was known to knock back quite a few dogs in his day. HAHA. Anyway back to the food. All i can say is i was a little disappointed. I was excepting a lot more flavor from the chili but it was just OK. The onion rings were really good and i left a bit confused wanting to come back again. \n\nA few days pass and im thinking The Varsity AGAIN. This time im going get it the way i thought would make the flavors pop (i also wanted to try a burger). This time i get a #2 with frys a side of cheese, onions, and a Orange Frost. This time there was a little more flavor having the cheese on the dog but it still was just ok at best. The burger was pretty much in the same boat as the dog. Just OK. They frys seemed like that had been sitting for a while like crappy In and Out frys lol. The best part was the Orange frost. MmMmm that was the best part of my meal. I was totally not expecting that to be so damn good! It was like drinking a creamsicle! \n\nNow I know the varsity has LOTS of history but the food was just OK not a place i would be jumping for joy to eat at again. If you like the Chili from the Varsity try Tommys Burgers if your ever in LA. Tommy's chili blows this chili out of the water!",

Staff doesn't seem to know much about their business or the community. They have a small selection; and yet their website makes the bizarre and false claim that \"by providing more brands and more products then any other independent store, we can eliminate the hassle of having to go store by store to get exactly what you need.\"  The website also says CP is a \"family owned business,\" but it provides no information about the  family that supposedly owns it, - not even their names or how to reach them if you have questions or concerns. There is a link to \"owners\" on their website - which takes you to lots of photos of people with their pets (presumably dogs they bought at the store, but who knows!).\n\n. . .And there are the dogs - I've seen them go for as much as $1800!  No good breeder would sell their dog through a pet store.  I feel sorry for the well meaning and unsuspecting people who come to this place, see a cute sad dog behind plexiglass, and then fork over nearly 2K..\n\n. . .And there is this weird sign - \"WE DO ADOPTIONS\" - meaning NOT that they work with rescues to help find homes for homeless pets, but rather that they will take your dog and  . . . supposedly find it a new home (?)\n\n I am glad to see the other reviewers on Yelp have also wondered about this place.  \n\nMy hope for Champion Pets is that  they will read their YELP reviews and realize they need to have a care; that they will make a commitment to being a good business and making a difference; that they will become more involved in the south lake neighborhood; and that they will work with animal lovers and owners, and rescues, and shelters, and vets to improve the lives of animals in their community.\n\nIf all else fails, perhaps the desire to have a more prosperous business will motivate this place to change.",

Allow me to state my case:\n\n1.  You don't call somebody's grandpa a waste of space just because he didn't know what he wanted the moment he stepped up to the door.  Especially when his grandkids are with him.  \n\n2.  A condescending \"theeeere ya go\" after someone places their order after 3.7 seconds of deliberation is wildly uncalled for.  \n\n3. You don't fly off the handle at a mom with three grade schoolers in tow because she called your offerings \"dogs\"  instead of \"sausages.\"  So maybe its technically incorrect to call a lingui\u00e7a a dog, but the place IS called \"top dog,\"  not \"top sausage,\" and a mom with three little ones frankly has more important things to worry about.     \n\nThe place was crowding up with families when I was there, people coming in with a good mood to get a tasty top-dog, and the guy at the grill (who kept on calling it \"my store\" when he was berating people) managed to infect everyone there with his stress and tension.  Even though it was  sunny day, we scowled for three blocks after we left.  \n\nRudeness for rudeness' sake doesn't fly anywhere. Not in south bronx, not in the outskirts of Beijing (both much grittier places where meanness might command respect), and certainly not in sunny, family-filled Berkeley.  This wasn't a display of the admirably strong political views posted all over the store (which I appreciate),  it was just gratuitous, senseless meanness that, in my view, makes it a business not worth soliciting. \n\nI'm not your typical sensitive type.  Just read my other reviews.  But I do take offense when sweet mommas and grandpas are belittled needlessly in front of their kids and grandkids.  Imagine being six and hearing someone say mean things to your mom.  Or grandpa.  It doesn't matter who they are or what they're grilling. It's just wrong. \n\nI'm taking my money and my cravings for well-garnished things-on-buns elsewhere.",

First and foremost he was very knowledgeable about curly hair, how to cut it, and how to style it. He wasn't trying to sell me any product in there just to sell it he actually recommended some super cheap sally's products that he said would do the same thing as some of the expensive stuff. He took the time to talk to me about my hair and who I can maintan my curls. \n\nThe salon is very different but I liked!!. It had a very edgy feel to it and the stylists fit in really well with the salon. Everyone was very polite and helpful, and one stylists brings her little dog in. But be prepared because if you don't have treats the dog won't talk to you! LOL!!\n\nMy hair cut was $40 which to me is not a lot for a good knowledgeable stylist. Alot of people have been complaining about the cost and you really get what you pay for when you try to go with a cheaper stylist. It is funny how people will pay hundreds of dollars for jeans, shoes, and purses which people only see every once in a while, but when they get their hair cut or colored they want to spend the least amount possible even though people see your hair every day.\n\nQuit being cheap people and get a good hair cut!!",

The meat case was decimated on Sunday at 12;30 pm. Brown edged ground beef was completely unappealing and a dried up pork tenderloin and two chops looked pretty paltry. Better to take those to the back, use them in the kitchen and close up the meat case and say you ran out than sell that stuff - trust me it's unappetizing.\n\nThe menu is way too limited to satisfy the masses - especially the breakfast menu which lacks enough of the interesting pork items.\n\nWhat we ordered was the three little pigs. They were all OK to good but frankly we were shocked we did not get sick later in the day as all the food temps were nowhere in the food safety zone of below 40 or above 140 degrees F. The dog felt cold in spots, the pulled pork was lukewarm and the pozole was barely warm. All dangerous temps for foodservice.\n\nAs far as taste the pork carnitas was the best - tender and flavorful but overcome by shredded carrot and coleslaw salad on top. the pulled pork was good and tender but lacked some zip in the sauce. The dog was totally lacking in seasoning and needs to be smoked or something - it was too plain.\n\nWould love to see them do well but with the limited breakfast menu and unsafe food temps they had better do some updates to their operations if they want to survive.",

If you want better food, go to Arbor Brewing Company, but it's definitely not as cozy and it'll cost you a little more.\n\nBeer, however, is what Ashley's does best.

Burdick, then it's almost a must to get something with chocolate.  This is where my mistake came.\n\nI met up with an old colleague who lives in the area, and he loves the hot chocolate there (and the place itself is also quite charming).  I've had the hot dark cocoa in the past, and it was good (dense and creamy...perfect for a wintry day).  But yeah...we came during a blistering HOT August day, so no awesome hot chocolate can convince me to order one when I was sweating like a hog. :-P\n\nPlan B?  Order an iced (caramel) soy latte and a slice of the orange hazelnut cake (there's chocolate icing!).  Grave mistakes -- (1) flavored latte shouldn't be iced.  The caramel didn't quite melt and blend, so I ended up with a latte with caramel bits sedimented to the bottom. (2) The hazelnut orange cake was awfully dry!  While the flavors were there, it was almost inedible.  To append to that, my friend got a shortbread torte with nuts and cranberries, and literally, it was like eating a rock, blech!\n\nLesson learned?  Go during a wintry day and get their hot chocolate.  Try their desserts at your own risk.",

While we can argue the merits of the chili and the ambiance I think we can all agree that this is a \"parlor\".\n\nI like this place a lot. The staff is genuinely friendly without making you feel like you are at Chotchkie's. The chili is excellent and not blazingly, cripplingly hot. This is good. I don't *like* chili that is too hot. The same mentality that complains about food that is not hot enough is the mentality that insists martini's don't have vermouth. A martini without vermouth is cold gin (which is fine, if that's what you like) and chili that is all hot and no flavor is a drag. If you need to prove your manliness by smirking at non-nuclear chili, well, go somewhere where the chili is equal parts Alpo and cayenne pepper and leave the rest of us alone. \n\nFor the record, the XXX is still pretty spicy. It will satisfy all but the most scarred palate.\n\nThe chili is not made with ground beef - it's big meaty chunks of beef. Very satisfying. Get the Frito pie, which is a big scoop of chili on a bed of Fritos sprinkled with cheese, onions and jalapenos. Delicious!\n\nI would call the decor and atmosphere \"calculated dive\". It's scrubby, but charming. It's a dive, but a docile one.",

We decided to sit inside because we didn't want to look at the ugly construction site that is across the street at the Stanford hospital. Here is what we got and what I thought:\n\nRicotta pancakes w/ fruit and syrup - solid pancakes, but was left wanting something savory.\n\nSausage and peppers w/ onions and scrambled - Scramble was perfectly down, moist in the center. Sausage looks homemade and the flavor is wonderful. I could eat a plate full of just that. This one I will order again.\n\nHot chocolate dark chocolate - WOW! Dark and rich hot chocolate, how a hot chocolate should taste. This ones was awesome! \n\nLatte - Nice and strong, the place is Italian, they like their coffee. No surprise here.\n\nBomboloni - essential an Italian cream filled donut. The dough is nice and dense, but soft and the cream is very nice. I like this one and would order it again.\n\nZeppole - Italy's version of the donut hole, but slightly moist in the center. Great with coffee. \n\nThis place knocked out of the park. Every dish and item we got was prepared with care. It clear the owner and the chefs here take pride in the food, and it shows in how everything tastes. Tootsie's is now my go to place for breakfast/brunch. Come check it out for yourself. Salud!",

I had my first falafel here. In a wrap, it was delicious and definitely a larger portion than I had imagined. In addition to the falafel sandwich, I also had my first Viennese coffee here (with whipped cream and cinnanananamin :-P). \n\nBoth were great to start off with, followed by a cup of hot chocolate (which was missing it's whipped cream), a hot apple cider, and another hot chocolate (again missing the whipped cream). I want my whipped cream damnit!  The hot apple cider actually got slimy towards the bottom of the cup due to the congealed cinnamon combination. \n\nDespite these minor misdemeanors I actually did enjoy my food and beverages. I liked the atmosphere and it fit the description of a coffeehouse. The staff was excellent with being able to accommodate our large group, having a whole section set off in a reserved section for us, our slowly trickling group, the children, and all the craziness that was of the crafter's group. 5 stars to our server! \n\nI wouldn't mind coming back here if Harvard had more public parking. It's definitely somewhere new I can get some studying done.",

My sister and her husband ordered breakfast burritos that were surprisingly large.  I ordered a non fat iced mocha and Joe K. had a latte.  We shared a lemon poppy seed scone.  Everyone really enjoyed ourselves as we sat outside at the one and only table that they had room for just by the front door.  \n\nThis coffee house is also an art gallery that displays quite a few interesting paintings along its walls with their asking prices.  While this shop looks small from the outside, the inside is very spacious and can accommodate a large crowd.  They also have a place sectioned off where live music is performed on certain nights.\n\nThe coffee, the food, the staff, and especially the company made our relaxing morning visit a highlight of my vacation.

He even got special turndown service treats!\n\nNow onto human amenities - they have a great spa, I love their bliss products and they make sure to  leave the mini versions of their products everyday, even asking what \"flavor\" I like best.  Their Whiskey Blue bar is amazing, loved the atmosphere and I found their NineThirty restaurant to be outstanding.

I am not usually a dessert person, but I got a little plate of fresh cinnamon donuts served with a trio of dips - a bourbon creme, a pumpkin butter, and a caramel. It was so good I devoured every bite.  Our server was attentive and very schooled on the menu. The place itself is really home-y and charming. It's nice to see them still sticking to their local, fair-trade roots, but really  stepping up the level of cuisine. I did find the prices a little high to really frequent the place, but I will be back for sure.",

I have a single speed SE Draft, and the hills around town were just KILLING my thighs and calves, SO...\n\nI went in and asked for their advice on how to make my commutes 'friendlier\", (bear in mind I was seriously thinking about going back to a mountain bike)?  Mike told me, \"I can change the flywheel to an 18 tooth instead of your stock 16 tooth\".  I had no Idea what he was talking about, but I said what the hell, just do it!\n\nHe had the old one off and the new one on in less that 2 minutes, and for the LOW LOW LOW price of $10?   \"Come on now I said, $10, surely you're joking\"? I ended up giving him a nice monetary tip, but the comfort I received WELL outweighed the price. \n\nSO, if you guys need and/or want something done to your two-wheeled machine, call these guys up, not only will they go easy on your finances, you will be given peace of mind as well.",

I had the opportunity to visit the Kilt after their opening day and I have been overwhelmed how friendly everyone is, starting with the owners dog who greets you in the driveway most days.  Then last week I was fortunate to have two lunches there.  I had the steak salad with lots of ground pepper---it was just wonderful.  Then we had the calamari with the best batter and sauces to dip into.  Then we brought on the Prime Rib sandwich, absolutely fantastic.  These people know how to cook!!!!  Then I chased it down with a House Merlot which was priced right and very good.  It has many TV's and music but nothing too loud that you cannot sit there and have a discussion.  I believe that this place will be a huge success story and be in SLO for many years to come.     Steve B.",

There was also a nice looking patio, but not so nice on a December night.\n\nWe walked in and I greatly enjoyed the laid back atmosphere and as good as you can get in America pub vibe.\n\nThe selection of beers was quite impressive and I went with a 512 IPA as I needed some real Austin beer before I left.\n\nThe menu had traditional pub fare and a good selection of burgers.\n\nHad I not had to wake up at 3 the next morning, I would have loved to have stayed longer, but the serving staff was incredibly friendly and I hope to return.",

I noticed that Tomoko's designs are evolving into wearable without veering from her personal style. They were a little out there for  me 4 years ago...or maybe I've evolved? ha. Her accessories are delightful. Cute cute bags and hats and stuff for your doggy. She's got some stuff to offer for the men...Though I don't see my Vans-Nike loving boyfriend wearing her wares...\n\nA little on the pricey side, because the girl works hard for the money! It's hard to pay the rent, feed the dog, look fabulous, AND sew the style people!\n\nIt's not ON telegraph but off a corner on telegraph. Find the 510 Skateboard shop, and it's across it.\n\nJust in case, you may want to call ahead and make sure the store's open (CLOSED ON MONDAYS BTW!) because I've found my self disappointed to discover it closed.",

The Cajuxican menu is interesting, while nothing is done to combine the styles and flavors. They're solely made to be neighbors. Jambalaya with your fajita? Why not, both end in A.\n\nWhat I can't get past is how incredibly, absolutely, and undeniably SALTY every dish is. My fish tacos, black beans and rice, along with Laura K's enchiladas and aforementioned jambalaya, bore so much sodium, a family of deer started eyeballing our table. Scram Bambi.

Their deserts alone are reason to come here, but add in the pastrami sandwiches, the roasted artichokes, a great wine list and some of the friendliest servers around and you could have a fabulous meal and tons of fun.  We sat outside today on the patio (where the service was quite a bit slower than normal), but it was still the perfect spot for people watching, a few cool beverages and...food!  \n\nFor those of you who haven't eaten here before, everything is HUGE!!  I mean, we're talking the size of a small country.  The kid had a hamburger that was so gigantic, she'll be eating for the next three meals.  My French Dip was tttttttaaaaaassty, but I couldn't finish it.  Even Hubby couldn't down the whole plate of Painkiller (corned beef, pastrami, Swiss, sauce - yum!).  \n\nThis month they have a special menu of artichoke and asparagus dishes.  Honey, if you like either of these green goodies, get your little self down here and have some of the best dishes that will ever cross your table!

I felt a little different and couldn't pinpoint it at first, but then I look back and saw it: my feet, flat on the floor. A wave of an absolutely awesome feeling washed over me. I felt like one million dollars.\n\nAnd now, the brief story of how I got this place where I never thought I'd be:\n\nSarah, Jenn and Karma (the three instructors who's classes I attend most) have been amazing all in different ways, but essentially have been welcoming, helpfully adjusting me along the way, providing a sanctuary of calm, a center of learning without judgment and encouragement when it's needed the most. Though I'm still in my very newbie stages, I've come to learn some terms, feel more comfortable with myself in my practice and even sometimes try the every-so-slightly more advanced poses, though I still always take a spot at the back of the room.  \n\nFive stars for helping this clumsy gal find her balance!",

I asked for the Hard Core Cider....they were out.  I asked Sweetwater....BING! BING! BING!  Beer came out pretty quick and then I placed my order for the Meatloaf sandwich.  About 15 minutes later, I received my order and the sandwiched smelled wonderful as she brought it to the table.  I took one bite and the meatloaf just melted in my mouth.  Boy was this thing good.  \nI would have definately given them \n5 stars if they had the beer on tap that I wanted....I guess you can't get everything you want.  :-)\n....did I mention that you can actually order a bowl of Captain Crunch Cereal?

When you ask a simple question, expect a condescending and mean answer.  I simply ask, \"Is there a line for those who made appointments.\"  She answers, \"IT'S RIGHT THERE!\"  Wonderful!  \n\nThere aren't any pens in this location, so when I ask the employees, they kept screaming at me \"WE HAVE PENS ON THE TABLE!\"  Nope, sorry, even a blind person could tell they've all been jacked.  The next step would be to ask an employee if you could borrow one, but albeit, they wouldn't even give water to a severely dehyrdated dog.  They're that mean.  I had to make a trip back to my car in the parking lot across the street to grab a pen, and of course, my number gets called in the process and I have to wait in line all over again.\n\nThe bottom line: avoid this filth of a DMV.

Thus, I will be stopping by Sprinkles later today for (edible) commemoration memorabilia. I will be getting:\n-1 carrot cupcake for him (yuck-good thing they only have it 3 days/week)\n-2 red velvets for me (available everyday)\nAnd their current \"seasonal\" flavors:\n-Brown sugar praline (available April 15-24)\n-Earth Day vanilla (April 18-22)\n-Flourless chocolate (April 18-26)\n-1 more flavor because I'm spontaneous like that\n\nSprinkles will always and forever be my favorite cupcake place. Ever since I had their red velvet, I promised to never stray...despite the disgustingness of the grease-infested cupcake wrapper post-consumption. I can compromise...it's not like people have cupcakes everyday, right?!\n\nOh, and those $2 cupcakes you were eyeing in hopes of saving a few pennies? DON'T! Those are for dogs.

The portion sizes have become much smaller while the prices have gone up. We are talking $12.95 for a plate of chicken nachos (previously $8ish on a huge platter)... which taste like they were made with last weeks grilled dry chicken and sour \"la victoria\" beans.\n2. The recipes for the food has changed... For the worse!!! They used to have the best salsa and now they have this goop that they call salsa... I can find better salsa in the supermarket for less than $3 dollars...\nThey don't have the yummy vegetable soup anymore... My former favorite spicy chicken wings taste like they have been microwaved to death!!!! \n3. Nothing is fresh anymore...  It's sad...

The mice and penguins make for beautiful feasts for the eyes as much as the taste buds.  \n\nIf you aren't looking for chocolates don't forget that they make a lovely selection of bake goods including a lovely raspberry tart which is my favorite.  You can also enjoy a lovely hot beverage to compliment your selection.

I'm talking real meat and seafood put into your choice of flour or corn tortilla. \n\nMy favorites include:\nBaja shrimp - fried shrimp with pickled onions and creamy chipotle sauce. \nThe Democrat - beef barbacoa with fresh avocado and tomatillo sauce.\n\nIf you love heat, may I suggest Brush Fire? Jamaican jerk chicken with grilled jalopenos, mangos and diablo sauce. They put habanero peppers in the diablo sauce, which makes it super spicy. I was literally in tears. But Torchy's is know for their hot sauces. They won almost every year at the Austin Chronicle Hot Sauce Festival.\n\nThe tacos are more on the expensive side $3-$4, now that there are other trailers that sell tacos too.",

This location is pretty convenient since its in a strip mall and if it were closer to where I lived I'd go more regularly.

The menu was small, I felt rushed into my order, though, and got the sweet potato panini. It was very bland, my side salad was so small I would have considered it a garnish instead. I couldn't decide what I wanted to drink, so I went back up for an Aztec hot cocoa. It took forever to come, they forgot to make it! I was very disapppointed when I finally got it. It tasted like warm milk with a small sprinkling of cinnamon (i'm 99% positive he forgot to put the chocolate in my hot chocolate). \nThe reason for the two star review over just one star was because my friend's turkey sandwich was good.

I think we got distracted by other foods and forgot how much we both like Indian food.  We've rectified this oversight lately, though.  The past two weekends we've both been too lazy to cook and so on Saturday night when the question of food is raised my answer has been a constant bhindi masala.  Whatever their secret ingredient is, it makes me crave more.\n\nThe restaurant is lovely (and a great place for the long conversations of first dates, I might add) but when weekend laziness reigns so does calling in an order for take-out.  That way only one of us actually has to work up the motivation to leave the house.\n\nIn addition to the bhindi, I'm a big fan of the lamb dishes, particularly the vindaloo.   The deliciousness here seems pretty consistent but the overall spiciness varies.  The first time we got the chicken 65 it was amazingly fiery hot.  Sadly our last order wasn't quite as atomic.  But either way it's the perfect combination of hot and flavorful, which is good since I'm not a big fan of super hot dishes that don't sport any interesting flavors beside omg-wow-that's-so-hot-it-hurts.  I'm also not as much of a machoist as I used to be, though, so I think I might actually prefer the milder version.\n\nAnd, not to obsess too much over the bhindi masala, but it is important to note that it's delicious cold the next day for lunch too.  Hey, sometimes lazy applies to microwaving leftovers too.",

The lobby is clean, brightly lit and open. There is a restaurant on the first floor but I didn't try it. We stayed in room 290 located in the tower (apparently there is also a room 290 located in the older part of the hotel). The King size bed was comfortable enough and the room was rather spacious. Some weird/cons about this place are: a couple outlets did not work, the drapes are not meant to fully close and the coffee machine was located in the bathroom (see? Weird). The elevator is rather slow, however, since I stayed on the second floor, the stairs worked for me. The Bath and Body (vanilla scented) bathroom products were a nice surprise and there were more towels than I needed. \nMy only criteria that was not met when searching for a place to stay was that this place is not dog-friendly.  Please note that the website states this place is pet-friendly and if you call the Holiday Inn Corporate Office*, they will re-assure you that this place is pet-friendly. BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT IT IS NOT PET-FRIENDLY. When I checked in, I inquired about the pet fee and the receptionist said that they were pet friendly about a year ago but not anymore and that it is a $175 penalty if they catch you with an animal. Since we got into town pretty late, we didn't have the option of finding another hotel so my poor puppy had to spend the night in the car; luckily the weather was cool enough for her. \n\nWe ended up staying only a night and yes, I made sure my puppy peed on your lawn, Holiday Inn Ithaca.\n\n\n*I called this hotel site to double check but couldn't get a hold of a receptionist, so hence, corporate office reference.",

My friend and I split sweet potato fries which a sweet citrus based dipping sauce, and my main course was the Bimbimbop.  Not your traditional Korean version per se, but a nice, fresh, collection of veggies/rice.  What really put it over the top was the hot sauce I asked for on the side (absolute must) - ended up being a homemade mayo based sriracha/hot pepper sauce, to die for with this dish.\n\nCan't speak too much to ambiance since I was seated outside, but looked really nice inside, if not a bit crowded.\n\nOverall, very nice experience.",

Ugh I'm going to have to stop at H.E.B after this because there is NO food in the fridge and I can't listen to Daniel bitch anymore about 'if you don't learn to cook, I'm not going to marry you'. Why doesn't he just say he doesn't want to marry me because I'm a fat slob? Ugh, I should just blow off working out and go to Ron's pub instead. Too bad I can't because I'm a disgusting human.\"\n\nThoughts of the same person who has just left hot yoga:\n\n\"God, I feel skinny! I deserve to go have a beer at Ron's! But first I should go home and wash this glisten off myself. Wow, I am sexy! I can't wait to cook a big delicious meal for Daniel and rub his feet after. He is amazing, I love him...Woah that is SUCH a pretty tree! I should wake up early and surprise everyone at the office with lattes and donuts.\" \n\nSeriously, hot yoga will whoop your ass. But you will feel SO amazing after that it is really worth a try. I had my first and only experiences in hot yoga at their Fountainview location, but I found everything to be pretty inviting for a newcomer. To my surprise, there were all ages and body types in the classes so I didn't feel intimidated by the other patrons. The staff is helpful but they are strict on the rules here especially when it comes to your classes expiring. They offer several times in the evening so try them all to find which instructor you prefer.  I will agree with others' diagnosis of \"smelly\" but hey, what can you do? It's 50+ people packed into a 105 degree room working their butts off...\n\nYes, it's hot, you will wonder what the hell you were thinking about 10 minutes into it, but you will slip into the zone and before you know it, you're done!

I am very new to yoga in general and very new to hot yoga, but each time I have been here (which is a handful at this point) I felt comfortable. The skill level of the participants varies so if you are intimidated by the person next to you doing headstands...well...I can't help you. I take breaks, I don't do some poses if it is too much for me and I feel completely okay doing that. \n\nThe instructors are all different as to be expected. Some focus more on meditation than others, some don't do much with meditation.  I like that in that each class feels different to me and not like I am doing the same thing over and over. However, the skill level of the classes tend to skew more intermediate than beginner so again, do what you can and don't worry if you can't do it all.\n\nIt is hot. Thus, the hot yoga. I have never sweat so much in my entire life, but I think that is a good thing. Bring water, a mat, a towel if you need. Come prepared to sweat.\n\nThe \"but's\".... Most classes are VERY crowded. The weekend AM classes especially. Part of this is due to the fact that they have run several daily deal specials. They have done Living Social and Rue La La that I know of. Hey, I came here through a Living Social. There are classes where there is almost no space between you and the next person, so be prepared for a sweaty butt in your face. I am okay with that, but if you don't like crowded, hot rooms this is not your ticket.\n\nAnother \"but\" is that the coat/shoe/putting yourself back together area is really small. So after class everyone is all over each other trying to get out of there. It can be hard especially since part of that area is right in front of the elevator. So, the studio space in that sense is tight. The yoga room itself is large and clean.\n\nOverall I like it here, it might be out of my budget after my Living Social, but we'll see. I would keep coming back (which is the goal of these Daily Deals, to get repeat customers, so in that sense, they will probably be successful with me).",

They have a good selection of sandwiches and sides--some of the sides look incredible, in fact, like the marinated artichokes--and are very reasonably priced. They have a Subway-ish model of service, where you order a sandwich, they start to assemble it with pre-packs of meats, and then you point out which toppings you'd like on it. \n\nTheir Italian hoagie is not too bad, with mediocre bread (a little too soft), and decent meats. My main qualm is with their hot pepper selection. You can opt for jalapenos, which are hot but not right for an Italian hoagie, or their hot pepper relish, which is oddly sweet, in a gherkiny kind of way. \n\nThat said, they are vastly superior to the other options in the station, and I've never had a bad experience here.",

Then in more recent years, freshness seemed to have gotten a little skimped on, flavor made up mostly of salt, and you could see corners cut. I even went to my friend's 40th birthday and the food was all luke warm and chicken marsala was rubbery tasting and tasted like they had gotten it out of a lean cuisine box quality.\n\nSo anyways...it seems like perhaps either the restaurant has recognized this recent decrease in quality or due to the economy they recognized their need to be unique to keep on top...either way it's working. Food is getting much better, different types of homey yet unique italian dishes with a twist, piping hot. Just a couple of tweaks that they need. I had the calamari with balsamic and it was too much balsamic--perhaps a balsamic reduction drizzle would have been better. However, the cioppino I had was delicious---and enough food to feed a family, lol.\n\nService of course is always spectacular there and luckily that has never seemed to waver and because of that I had to try it out again and that's where I found these new dishes.

What could be better? \n\nBut then you walk through the door -- or more accurately, wade through the people squinting at the menu in the doorway. The poorly-designed menu takes some time to comprehend and since there is no table service, everyone gathers in the entryway. \n\nOnce you've decided, you order one or two skewers at about $7 a pop. Although there is no table service you are expected to leave a tip at the register when you order. I found this off-putting when paying with a credit card. Although I am an excessive tipper in most cases, I find it weird to ask for a tip just for placing an order.\n\nI ordered some Thai peanut skewers (these are most definitely not kabobs) in chicken and shrimp. They each had 3 pieces of meat, 2 pieces of broccoli, 2 slices of red bell pepper, and some onion. All on a bed of couscous. I suppose there was some peanut sauce in there somewhere but I didn't taste much. To say the plate is small would be an understatement.\n\nThe food is bland both in taste and presentation. And it is far too expensive for lunch, especially when you consider you'll have to eat something else later since the portions are so tiny. You walk out the door of Stixs hungry and bored.\n\nI can't imagine how this business will survive the The Drag's paradox of high rents and people expecting cheap eats. So far several of my work colleagues have visited this restaurant (which is mere steps away) and none have positive things to say. I know I won't be back.\n\nIf you want meat on a stick, go to Dog Almighty. If you want vegan food, hop down to Veggie Heaven, and there is better Asian food a block away at Ming's.",

                    "text": "But 4 Stars for:\n- handroll\n- dessert\n- service\n\nPretty good food, but pricey.\n\nWe ordered 3 spicy scallops handrolls, the sampler, and a dessert [don't know the name of it]\n\nThey brought out free edamame which was awesome. But when our sampler came out I was a little disappointed with the portions. When I order a sampler I expect it to have tons of food on the plate. It only came with two dumplings, 2 egg rolls [but they had a deal on 4sq for two free eggs so we ended up with four], and a bowl of calamari. All for $12. I don't think so. The calamari was pretty good but it needed sauce. I dipped it in other sauces that came with the dish.\n\nSpciy Scallops Handroll - was really good! I think because we also ordered it with light rice [which I am always gonna do btw] It was filled with so much scallops and it was actually spicy!! Very impressed.\n\nWe also ordered this dessert which we saw by someone else ordering it. We told our waitress we want that! Hahah it came with Mexican hot chocolate with an orange ice cream sandwich. It was amaaaaazing!! I'm a sucker for desserts. I've never had anything like it. The hot and cold went so well together. I would dip my ice cream sandwich in the hot chocolate. I need to come back here again and find out what this is called.\n\nOverall it was an okay experience. We did get hooked up on another bottle of sake only because we knew our waitress. Thank you! But that sampler was very disappointing. $12 for a dish that barely had anything on it. But I will come back for handrolls and that dessert., and up my review. OoOOwee!!",

It is these kinds of coffee shops that I strive to find in life, so thanks Algiers for being there. \n\nDefinitely not the cheapest place in the world, especially if you just want to grab a cup of coffee to catch up with a friend. I actually wanted to give this place 3.5 stars because of that. It is about $5 for one cup of mint coffee or hot chocolate here, which just seems a little ridiculous since you don't get a refill or anything and it is literally a normal sized coffee cup. But if you believe in paying for the ambiance through your purchases, than Algiers definitely makes up for it that way. And that mint hot chocolate was pretty delicious too! \n\nThis cafe is multi-leveled and there are tons of tables here scattered about in this middle-eastern style cafe, and just being here makes you feel like you have escaped everything that is Harvard Square.  It is just that unique which definitely will bring me back here. Their food is also not the cheapest but I have heard good things, so perhaps if I am feeling like splurging I will try out a sandwich or two the next time I come here. But this place is perfect for trying out some new teas or coffees and just sitting and chatting and catch up with old friends. And you'll be surprised how quickly the time goes while you're here!",

The food is THAT heavy. \nWhat no one mentions, and you may miss the sign at the order window: everything here is fried in LARD.  Yummy, I thought. The way chicken is meant to be fried.  Here, not so much. \n\nThe menu is basic, and touts the use of locally raised, organic poultry with some heft. Pieces are large; the crust hot and golden, the flesh juicy and tender. Two scents assaulted me as I took my first bites: garlic powder and that weird smell chicken on the bone has when it's not quite done. I find neither appealing. The second bite sent a deluge of hot liquid cascading down my forwarm; most of it grease.(All the better to bathe the burn given by the metal table in the sun.) The coating, more like fish & chip batter than traditional Southern style, holds onto hot oil like a sponge. Remember TV dinner fried chicken?  Even the fries left a thick coating on the roof of my mouth...thank goodness the side order filled an entire box by itself ;}\n \nThey've got one of the weirdest items I think I've ever eaten: a fried chicken liver salad sandwich. I read fried chicken liver sandwich at first before noticing the salad part. I kept thinking chicken liver salad, formed to a patty, and fried, like a crab cake. Couldn't wrap my head around it until I tasted it; the livers are fried, then made into a salad. Still heavy and weird; two bites were enough for me.\n\nIt's full on take away here...with only three tables and no inside seating. Everything, with exception to the lunch special, is ala carte. For the same $23, I could have feasted at Carver's, been entertained by the patrons and staff and had enough leftovers for dinner!",

                    "text": "I came here with a friend for Saturday lunch and was really pleased. The prices were a bit higher than I thought they should be, but the food itself was all very delicious. Service was completely fine, we were seated quickly and orders taken in a reasonable time frame. \n\nI got a deluxe lunch bento box ($19), and chose the chicken teriyaki and tuna sashimi (three pieces) options. Both regular and deluxe bento boxes also come with three california roll, two gyoza, two shumai, two vegetable tempura, a small salad, miso soup and white rice. Certainly filling enough for lunch and everything was delicious. Miso was sweet and mild.\n\nMy friend chose a \"flaming wok\" lunch special ($17) with kung pao chicken, hot and sour soup, white rice, two crab rangoon and a small salad. I tasted both the kung pao and crab rangoon and they were very good. The hot and sour soup wasn't bad at all, but it wasn't exactly \"hot\" or \"sour\", and instead a bit milder and plainer than I expected - this was the only item I thought was somewhat lacking. I haven't had crab rangoon in a really long time and was really excited with this one. We each had a soda for $2.50 each.\n\nThe place was clean and bright. Probably better for lunch than dinner in my opinion. Music was fine (boring but fine). Bathrooms were clean and far from dining tables which was nice. Location isn't the best, but if you are in the area, or live in any of the nearby apartment/loft buildings this is worth checking out for sure.",

Even though you are probably not too safe in Beirut or some of the the surrounding cities anymore, you are certainly safe at this Jerusalem.  : )    Walk right past the construction barriers on 5th Ave (circa March 2012) and you are there.\n\nThe trifecta of SE Med flavors for me are Hummus, Baba Ghanoug, and either Falafel or Kibbeh. So I had a Kibbeh platter with the previous two items and the yogurt/cucumber \"dip\" was supplied with the Kibbeh balls.\nThe Kibbeh balls were not greasy and had perfect texture and flavor. The lamb came through, but it's gaminess was not overpowering. \nThe chunky cucumber was perfect with the Kibbeh. And you could dip it or just eat it. I did both.  : )\nThe Baba was spot on, and perhaps a little more garlic laden than the norm. Fine by me. The roasted garlic and eggplant flavors were turning my pale Anglo Saxon skin an olive brown. lol  \nThe Hummus was creamy and perfect. It was thin enough to dip but still thick enough to control without spilling it all over. This is a hard thing to get right, so I appreciate it.  \nThe only things I could critique here are the thinish and served-cold pita, and the use of Frank's Red Hot as a hot sauce. I liked both things okay. But I prefer pillowy soft and warm pita. And for me, the hot sauce should be Sambal Oelek or something similar... but I submit that is not of the same origin as the food. \nGreat place.",

Of course they have maintained their staples of cookies and ice cream, but they have recently added ice cream sundaes and Hawaiian shaved ice. They have also gotten rid of hot dogs, which they had for many years. Although the hot dogs were cheap, like everything else on their menu, I could never bring myself to try one. It just didn't seem right that a cookie shop would be serving hot dogs. However, with Diddy's new menu items, they have returned to what they do best. Sweet treats! \n\nThe Hawaiian shaved ice has been on the Diddy Riese menu for a little while now, and I finally tried it this past week. I went with one of the recommend flavor mix choices that they had on their menu board. It was a cherry pina colada type concoction served on top of a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was excellent! The sweet syrup flowed through the ice and infiltrated the flavor of the ice cream in sugary goodness. Now I'm not going to tell you how Diddy Riese has some scientific, revolutionary process in how they shave their ice in order to achieve amazing texture, because they don't. What I will say is that for a $1.50 this is a great treat, and I am looking forward to having it again...and again \n\nI am also looking forward to trying a Diddy Riese ice cream sundae soon. It is the newest addition to the menu, and I will have to choose between a sundae or one of their other sweets the next time that I go.  It will be a hard choice, but I am already thinking about what I will choose.",

The food just doesn't taste quite the same.\n\nI have been to this place so much that the owners know me and are so so nice. They know what I typically order (Chicken Biryani Hot and Garlic Naan). They also deliver which was great when I lived on Chapel Hill's campus. They are by far the fastest delivery to campus and the food is amazing. I haven't found any Indian food that matches it yet.",

                    "text": "I've lived in a couple other apartments in Palo Alto, both near downtown, tiny and overpriced with none of the amenities that you can get at Stanford West. My last apartment was an old jr. 1 bedroom (more like a studio) with no parking and a kitchen just like Harry Potter's room (seriously it was tiny and built under the stairs). The person renting there is now paying $1800 (sucker!). With the way rent is going in this town, SW's rates are competitive for its location and what you can get for your money.\n\nFirst, you need to meet the eligibility requirements. Those that work at Stanford University get priority, then the Stanford hospitals, then others. But once you get an apartment it's pretty sweet. Living 5 minutes from work is awesome!\n\nI have a 2 bedroom split floor plan. The master has an en-suite bathroom, walk-in closet and it's own heater/air conditioner unit. The living/dining area is average size, and works for my small family. My kitchen has been upgraded with granite counters and has a nice sized pantry for storage. My son's room only has a heater - would be nice if it had air conditioning. His bathroom is separate. The unit comes with a full size washer and dryer. Living on the ground floor allows me to have a nice sized patio with space for a patio set and BBQ. I was lucky enough to get an apartment with an attached garage. Most units have separate garages - but hey that's better than the majority of apartments in PA!\n\nAnother major plus is that pets are allowed. Very few apartments take pets around here. Pet rent is $25/month and there's a $1000 pet deposit. There are tons of paths to walk your dog and even waste bag stations to clean up after it.\n\nOther amenities include: 2 heated pools and spas, a modern fitness room with Stanford wifi, BBQ area, playground, a convenience store, a car wash area, free car vacuum and a Marguerite stop. Too lazy to take your trash to the dumpster? Leave the bin outside your door and valet trash will pick it up at night. I always see security walking around so I feel safe. It does get noisy during the day with landscaping, deliveries, etc.\n\nCheck it out, it's great living here.",

Finally the girl working at the bar finished her things and seated us. Either that or the hostess was doing a few things at the bar....I'm not sure. Then we sat down and waited a looong time to get a waitress. It wasn't bad, since we talked a lot, but otherwise the service was horrendously slow. The bright part of this was that the waitress was courteous and cheery, and apologetic. We took a long time to ponder over the menu, not because we're indecisive, but because the service was just that slow. My gf and I got the Chicken & Biscuit and Irish breakfast.\n\nI liked the biscuit....but then again, it was smothered in gravy and hot sauce. I'm sure the hot sauce was pretty much the only flavor...and I don't mind that, just that I wouldn't taste much else. The chicken was a butterflied breast that was ridiculously dry. It's ok, hot sauce saves everything. \n\nThe good part of my brunch was the Irish breakfast. My gf didn't get what was happening here 'cause she thought the potato cake was \"just ok\". I really liked it, though. It was a little sweet, had a good onion-y taste and was fluffy and soft--kinda like someone took good mashed potatoes and fried it in a cake. I also loved every egg that we had, which were two poached eggs and a sunny-side up. They were cooked perfectly. I would definitely get something with egg again. The portabella looked like crap, honestly, but it tasted great. \n\nThe beer was indeed kinda expensive, but there are good, cheap options, too.",

I've had better chili from a red can that says \"Wolf Brand\" on it.   Yeck.   I can't even being to explain why I kept coming back and trying the Chili again and again...\n\nBut like I said, if you're in the neighborhood (Cloak Room perhaps?), you should have a drink here to say you've been.

Consider it a more sophisticated cousin of bubble tea. \n\nI tried the Tropical Rainforest (photo included) which had muddled limes and apple slices adorning a mountain of lightly sweetened tea/juice. The Lavender Earl Grey was refreshing and elegant as well; it's sweetened with creme and brown sugar. It's nice to be able to have two sizes to choose from too. The large only set me back $4. The large lasted me 3+ hours as I stayed glued to my laptop with their free wi-fi. My friend got a $4 hot tea and was able to split with a friend and both were quite satisfied. \n\nThey have some desserts available but no hot food as of yet. You might need to take a break from studying to wander down the Ave for food and come back. I like the layout and decorations but the space is mostly dominated by 2 person tables.

The Rutgers Club (and their Chef) has consistently won awards for culinary excellence. I've gone there both as a student as a staff member, and I was consistently blown away by the quality of the food that they serve. \n\nWhen I was invited to go to Penn's University Club, I had similar expectations. Boy, was I disappointed. First, the whole dining room smells of tuna fish. Not really sure why. But that's a turnoff for me. Next, I didn't really see any fresh entrees. I guess their thing here is a hot/cold buffet, and it was just meh. I guess all the food is cooked by the Inn at Penn kitchen, and I've had much better food at meetings that were held in that same hotel. Really disappointing. Chicken was kind of lukewarm and devoid of flavor. I got a roast beef sandwich that was dry and frankly almost stale. This is a far cry from the hot, sit down meals that were served at the Rutgers club. \n\nI guess if you want to show off your 'membership', it's worth hitting up the buffet lunch here. Otherwise, you can get much more mileage for your $10 and change, and go someplace that will serve food that might actually have some character.",

It's great.\n\nThe best things about Grendel's are: There's a varied, comfort-food filled menu that is consistently delish, and it's super cheap. In fact, come here on weekdays before 7, and everything you order to eat is 1/2 price with purchase of one drink. In the Winter months, I always get a turkey burger, hot cider with rum, and share a hummus appetizer. In the Summer months, I pretty much have the same thing, sub the hot cider for white wine. I love the food, I love the place and I love the fact that it can cost less than $20 for a starter, entree and drink.\n\nFor newbies: You need to grab a seat, so don't wait for a waitress to greet you, and try to get a table in the back up the stairs, because it's farther from the door (I suppose that only matters in Winter). Come Summertime, the patio opens up, and that's fun, too.",

I tried the Diavaola pizza along with the vegetarian pizza my friend ordered, I am sorry to say that I'm not a fan.  The Diavaola pizza was super hot as in spicy hot because of the peppers they put on it and the flavor was not what I thought it would be.  The vegetarian pizza I thought was just bland.  I know many of you will not agree with me, but I'm entitled to my opinion.  \n\nI also agree with another review I read on here.  I'm also not a real huge fan of the pushy eating feeling experience. There's crowds of people, it's very loud, has limited seating, and you get that rush rush feeling of eating because you have people looking at your table to see how much food you have left so they can move in once you are done eating.  All that rushing, bumping other people is just too much for me.  If you do find a place to sit consider yourself lucky.   If you like to take your time eating and enjoying the company of your friends without that \"rush\" feeling, this is not a place to go.",

I usually go for the lamb or steak pita, but if I'm really hungry, I'll order the wowshi. The wowshi is this warm, doughy, calzone-like thing, stuffed with the meat that you order, and then popped into the oven for a few minutes until it's baked to perfection. \n\nNow onto the toppings bar: I start off with a squirt of tahini sauce, then the regular hot sauce, the tomato/onion mix, tons of cabbage, a little bit of lettuce, and then top it off with the herb dressing. If you get the fries, then I recommend mixing the hummus and hot sauce and using that as a dipping sauce instead of ketchup. Yes, I'm a sucker for condiments, and yes, I try to stop by Bella Pita once a week. \n\n1 star off for the lack of seating, but besides that, I can't complain. It's cheap, quick, and delicious.",

Seriously, they all act like they have sticks up their asses.  I understand it was 8 in the morning when I went in there and they're probably tired, but that shouldn't even be an excuse to treat anybody like shit. I ordered a hot coffee and decided to get an iced coffee instead, so I went back to change my order. The guy at the cash register rolled his eyes and became extremely pissed off as he poured my iced coffee. I was so taken aback that I didn't even say anything. I was even about to pay, which usually you shouldn't be charged to switch hot coffee for iced coffee, but I really did not care to pay and I asked if everything was ok. He rudely said it's more expensive but now you can have that coffee for free and he walked away. I later went and asked for his name and he wouldn't give it to me and said I gave you the coffees so what's the problem. Clearly he thinks he's something special, which he's not. And I did get his name and I'm going to go talk to his manager today. He does not deserve a job if he's going to be a little spoiled brat about me paying 1.65 when it's not going in his pocket.",

We tried the \"Hot Mamma Huda\" and the \"Spiffy Tiffy.\"  Both were pretty good, but I liked the Huda better, because it had a little kick (because of the Frank's Buffalo sauce). You also get your choice of chips or a piece of fruit.  They also give a nice caramel apple lollipop with every sandwich!  Friendly service.  The stanford location was a little hard to find, because it is inside one of the engineering buildings, but there is plenty of seating inside.",

                    "text": "What a disappointment.  Although I did not expect a real \"New York\" deli sandwich in LA county (other than Canter's, Langers, Katz's), I did expect it to be better than this.  First off, I only went in there because the Dog Haus next door had a line going out of the door.  And also, I was lured in by the \"special\" sign outside that featured a half sandwich with a side and drink for $6.49, or a whole sandwich, side & drink for $9.99.  Once inside I find that the $6.49 was for a turkey sandwich only, and the 9.99 was for an egg salad sandwich.  Really ???  Along with the misleading title of \"New York Deli\", this too was misleading.  I ordered their \"I love New York\" sandwich which is corned beef, pastrami, & swiss cheese.  The pastrami and corned beed had no fat, no taste, no flavor, a strange texture, and a peculiar color.  It looked more like shaved, pressed ham - like the discounted \"Buddig\" brand you got if you were a poor kid... that your mother tried to pass off as deli meat.  But at least that had some flavor.  The pale color of the meat and lack of taste suggested it had been boiled to death... prior to nuking it.  Yes nuked.  I should have known when I saw them put the meat in the microwave... that I was in for a not so pleasant experience.  I am not that poor kid anymore.  If I drop $15 bucks for a sandwich at Canter's I don't mind because I am satisfied with the quality and taste... it's worth it.  At Gandolfo's for 11 bucks... this is a ripoff.  I would have done better going to the Hat, Tops, etc..  At least it looks and tastes like pastrami for less than 7 bucks.  Also, I had to ask for a pickle and they did not put a napkin in the bag.  But then again, it wasn't juicy... so I guess they know that no napkin was required.  The state of New York should force Gandolfo's to remove their name from their title.  I gives NY a bad name.  I don't love NY, but I do love their food.  I did not like Gandolfo's or their food.  However it made me feel like I do whenever I go to NY... like I got robbed and jacked.  Ooooh.  Now I get it.  Maybe that's why they call it \"New York\" deli.  Because it too is a rip off!",

But you know what isn't cheap? Health care. I ordered steamed tofu and broccoli in garlic sauce, and, as per the usual, asked for it to be made blisteringly spicy. It was sort of hot...but it was also a neon orange oil overload. I think I literally grimaced when it was placed in front of me. The taste was okay, I guess, but I was a little too horrified to think about anything but the quantity of straight up fat I was ingesting.\n\nThe only reason I went to Pu Pu Hot Pot was because the seriously superior Mary Chung's, which is pretty much right across the street, is closed on Tuesdays.

I must say I was shocked with the crowd on hand.  Even though the Knicks were playing the Heat, still impressive in my mind.  What drew me to Wing Central in the first place was their beer menu.  Certainly impressive.  A lot of recognized names on there, but also some you don't run across on your average day at the pub.  There were plenty of TVs for anyone looking for a great place to bed down for a Husky game.  All and all the food I saw looked great (didn't eat any because of my diet, but hey it looked fresh.)  Above all, my biggest take away from this place is their 'Hell Wing' sauce.  It is ridiculously hot.  Easily the hottest substance I have and (hopefully) will ever eat.  A lesson to learn...even though you may enjoy spicy food, does not mean you are ready for some uber spicy challenge.  Don't kid yourself...I know now, that I won't!",

Everything I saw was under $5!! \n\nSo glad I took that girl's recommendation! When we got the fried pickles (2 spears that are battered), it was piping hot! But when it cools down and take that bite, it was good! It's not just fried pickles like how places are deep frying whatever they can imagine. These fried pickles are a tasty treat! Not too sour and not too fried tasting. They served it with this dipping sauce that looked like a thousand island dressing but I wasn't too sure what it was. \n\nEither way, I'm glad I got the fried pickles. Pretty dang tasty.

She stops by with a friend to pick up this free lunch. The employees there were super nice, and gave them samples of the soups they wanted to get. Even though they had free coupons, the employees told us we could get any size they wanted (except quart), so they both opted for larges. The employees then reminded them that they get a free roll with the soup, oh how sweet. \n\nWhile Tiffany got her soup and was sliding down to the register, her bowl runs off a ledge on the uneven counter (please be careful of that!), and slips hot sample soup all over. She apologizes and tries to help clean up, but employee assures  her that its fine, and cleans it up himself. \n\nTiffany gets a tomato bisque soup-- tomato-y fresh and silky smooth texture. Friend gets New England Clam Chowder-- hearty with chunky, fresh ingredients. Soup was hot and satisfying.\n\nThis place set the standard for Tiffany for good soup; she is in love with this place! Great soup, great service, great employees. If only all SFSCs were as good as you..!",

Gourmet is a tiny hole in the wall, tucked away from the main drag at Stanford Mall, and you must eat outside or take your food elsewhere.  That's the minus one star.  The hot dogs are very good, freshly grilled while you wait, and you can get different varieties of sausage such as chicken apple, or even (gasp) vegetarian.  I got my Hebrew National with grilled sauerkraut.  They also have fresh lemonade in addition to a cooler of canned and bottled beverages.\n\nSome have complained of the price...it's Stanford Mall, tucked between Bloomingdales and Macys, right next to the GAP.  What do you expect?  This is the high rent district, and if you're on a budget, don't stop at Stanford which sits amongst the most expensive real estate in the world.",

The seaweed had no flavor but had a slightly fishy smell.  I'm used to flavored seaweed.  \n\nI did like the crunchy daikon.  The rest of the banchan was pretty forgettable but the salad was good and the romaine leaves were really fresh.   The meat was sliced super thin so you're not getting much meat on a plate.  The meat went really fast and our server didn't refill our banchan until we hunted him down.   I had to get my friend extra napkins as our server wasn't very good about checking up on us.  The rest of the staff was in the kitchen and only one person was serving the customers in the front so maybe they are short staffed. \n\nThe food was tasty and the amount was about right but the service was very slow.  Our food came out before our plates so we could only stare at the food.  The final tab came to about 60 dollars for three people so it's a little on the expensive side.    \n\nFYI, the coals for the table side BBQ  makes the air around the table really hot so you might not want to cook your own BBQ on a hot day. ; )",

Nevertheless, it's common to greet \"Whadalya have?!\" with \"Uh....uh.....huh?\"\n\n\"Whadalya have?!\"\n\n\"Uh, I'm thinking......well, maybe.....\"\n\n\"Whadalya have?!\"\n\n\"Please.....for the love of God, I don't know! The thinking part in my head is hurting!\"\n\n\"Whadalya have?!\"\n\n\"Please don't yell at me.\" (Sob!)\n\nThe venerable Varsity, target of much love and much derision. Honestly, I don't know how much of both it deserves. It does earn some respect just for being a constant in ever-changing Atlanta. It's grown some, added a little bit of technology here and there, but for the most part, it's remained refreshingly old-school. Some might call it \"predictable,\" but I think most of those people expect too much for too little. It's a drive-in, people. They serve chili dogs.\n\nBut then how ARE the chili dogs?  Aye, and that's the rub. They're not very good, even by chili dog standards. OK, they're not Checker's quality (which, to me, is the culinary equivalent of getting a thousand paper cuts on the head of your penis), but I've had much better chili dogs in my day. They're still better than the hamburgers, so I still stick with them.  Comparatively their onion rings, greasy though they may be, score much higher in my book. And the frosted orange (the original Orange Julius before Julius found it) truly deserves its place in Atlanta lore as does any fried pie. \n\nReally, though, to most the food is secondary to the experience--the experience of being an original old-school Atlanta institution filled with hustle, bustle and aged engineers re-experiencing their days of youth. Seen through the prism of nostalgia, The Varsity comports itself well. Taken as a restaurant in and of itself, not so much.  To me, that's the crux of the polarized opinions surrounding the Varsity. I understand both views and that's why I sit solidly at 2.5 stars. For the sake of Yelp and sentimentality (even though I never attended GA Tech), I'll round up to 3 stars.",

Their hoagies are not for the faint at heart, so be prepared to have your cholesterol checked before you visit this place.  This is the best sandwich shop in Princeton and probably in NJ.  They have a huge menu of hoagie subs and hot subs similar to the ones you will see in the grease trucks at Rutgers University.  These \"grease\" hoagies are also popular at Hoagie Haven.

The Merry Christmas roll is a December special that is made of spicy salmon and cilantro on the inside and fresh mango and avocado slices on the outside. The Caterpillar roll is the basic eel and avocado roll. The yummy crunchy roll was a spicy tuna, crab, cream cheese, and jalapeno roll that was breaded and deep fried like tempura. \n\nI will definitely be returning here again.

I had one that was fried chicken and egg, which sounds artery clogging, but it's very lightly fried (batter and soy sauce) and the egg is poached. Very good, and the service was great. \n\nIt's worth it just to check out the modern, clean look of the place (something Freshome.com would love), and quite the switch from T-Cloud, Chicken Bowl, el Mercado and the other grittier (but loveable) places along Lavaca. It's a nice new lunch option for sure, and probably does well at night--it has a swanky hipster vibe to it that probably plays well in the early evening. There's a neat looking outdoor area, but it's way too hot for that now.",

The decor is ascetic, the location is a strip mall. As for the neighborhood being \"too scary,\" I guess that might be true if you never venture outside your gated community. \n\nBottom line - if you are a vegetarian who likes Indian food, go.

Picture flourescent lights, tables and chairs from the '70s and a framed paper poster.   Their bathroom is spotlessly clean, which you'll need to wash your hands after digging into the perfectly fried wings, crunchy outside and moist inside.  The sauce is more on the vinegary side than hot, which is how I like my wings since I don't want a purple lip.  The wings are small or appears to be because the skin is thin.  I personally like thinner skins.  The fries are pretty good. Not as good as Nathan's Famous or McDonalds, but better than most.  Hamburgers are giant grilled patties on giant sized buns (larger in diameter than a Whopper).  Also cool about this place (if you like murder trivia) is that the former owners were Lyle and Erik Menendez (look them up in Wikipedia).",

Instead I go for the Beef Don (great, thin-sliced steak and onions), the deep fried pork rolls are delicious, and the Idaho Maki (sweet potato tempura roll) is the best I've ever had.\n\nBut my favorite thing here is the beef dumpling soup.  For $3.95 you get a fairly big bowl of hot, mildly spicy broth, some carrot shavings and four or five good sized dumplings (which should be slurped loudly while being bitten into!).  That's a terrific value, especially in a cold Boston winter.\n\nThe location is great, the decor is interesting, and the food is terrific.  Easily worth four stars plus a bit.",

I always got the vegan spuds for brunch and the waiter was so attentive, he got my soymilk for my coffee without me having to request it! Impressive service- and this was the case every time I returned here. The food doesn't disappoint either- their scrambled tofu is ridiculously good (has a curious egg-y flavor) and their rosemary rubbed roasted potatoes are HEAVENLY. Go try them. You won't regret it.\nI love the funky, eclectic decor, and while I'm not a fan of the hot pink walls, it certainly went with the theme. My friends and I loved the 'Audrey Hepburn' tabletop, full of clippings, pictures, and make up from an older, glamorous era. Love this place and I'm going back here for brunch soon!",

They're actually different enough for me to like both.  If you're choosing a place for ice cream in Princeton, you have a tough choice to make.",

However, I would agree that the cake to frosting ratio is a bit skewed/heavy on the frosting.  The place was packed on a Sunday afternoon with lots of excited customers.\n\nAlso loved that each cupcake got its own little hot cup/dixie cup thing with a lid to prevent them from falling over and getting messed up in transit.  :)\n\nAnd I didn't think $2.50 a cupcake was steep at all.

But large peach roses lying on each table make it great for business and \"business\" type of meals. \n\nSome of us started out with the cucumber and dill soup, which was too creamy and not cool enough though my eyes feasted. \n\nI then segued into the spaghettini with jumbo crab meat - very rich and creamy ($13). The salmon and duck breast dishes were more expensive ($15 and 16) however it was a huge slab of fish that my friend got and his born-in-France taste buds were satisfied. \n\nPortions are not dinner large, but neither are the prices ($8-$16 for entrees). The lunch menu is not extensive (less than 18 dishes, including appetizers, entrees, and dessert), bee tee dubs. \n\nOverall, this place resonates with pleasantness, so do come and try it for lunch.",

There were a few people waiting after me, so as soon as my nails were done, I was asked to move to a spot near the entrance so my nails could dry. Another employee tried to move the drying machine to a spot that was easily reachable for my feet, but the machine's cord was too short, so some awkward moving around had to happen.

Or maybe not a twist...but flavors not typical of greasy americanized mexican food...oh wait, is that what traditional mexican food tastes like?\n\nOkay, not let's not generalize the taste of Mexico...food here is authentic Yucatan cuisine. The boyfriend and I were in South LA and we're usually never in the area so we wanted to try something that was on that list of 99 things to eat in LA before you die...well Chichen Itza definitely deserves to be on that list! \n\nCame in knowing the place would be good but not having the Yelp knowledge to know what to order...thanks to the helpful staff, ordered the Cochinita Pibil. Shredded pork that came on a banana leaf with pickled onions on top and a side of beans rice, and hot tamales. The pork was very juicy and the onions added the crunch the dish needed. The hot sauce was also a nice blend of heat and acidy (from vinegar) and was really the perfect kick. Ahhh, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.\n\nAlso ordered the tamal colado. To me, the corn masa was a little strange...not as dense as I am used to...taking on a lighter more gelatinous feel? Definitely feels lighter/better for you but not really my tastes...the boyfriend liked it though.\n\nOverall, quite delicious. Good pricing and helpful staff. The only thing...I wish they had given more carbs for the pork dish. Proportionally there was much more pork than rice/beans/tamales...oh well, can't really complain that they're forcing me to eat more protein than carbs! :)\n\nOh, and Mo-chica is in the same complex!!! So shocked when I walked in and saw that but...had to follow my course! We wanted to try the lomo saltado there after but the appetizer and main dish left the two of us SO full..and that's a good sign! Will be back soon!",

                    "text": "Frankly, I had low expectations for a place that claimed to serve healthy-ish and tasty korean food in Westwood (aka not K-town). I almost expected it to be as frightening as the dim sum place that had previously occupied that space, but I was pleasantly surprised when I found instead a clean restaurant with welcoming, well-dressed service and straighforward bibimbop.\n\n I don't have much experience with bibimbop but ordering it at Bibigo was simple enough. Basically you order your type of bowl, type of rice, type of meat, and type of sauce. Then you grab a seat (and your kimchi) in either the indoor seating at the back or the equally relaxing patio (with heat lamps if you're a weather-spoiled Socal-er like myself) until they bring your food out to you. Another plus, you don't have to bus your own -- they do that too. \n\nI had the hot stone bowl with bulgolgi, barley and white rice, and kohot sauce. It was flavorful, actually piping hot, and not too greasy or heavy. Even though I essentially ate a huge pot of rice, I didn't feel overwhelming full or disgustingly greasy (big plus for relatively fast food). \n\nGreat place if you're stuck on the westside and you're hit with a sudden korean food craving. Bibigo makes ordering as simple and quick as Chipotle but with restaurant-style service and guilt-less food. Only 1 star off because it's slightly on the pricey side at a little over $10 per bowl, but then again, I'm used to K-town prices for korean food.",

The fall rolls in as I type this review, and I want nothing more than to enjoy some hot cider and cider donuts as I write it. Alas, I've yet to visit Atkins this year.\n\nPart farm stand, part specialty grocery, Atkins Farms holds on firmly to the New England charms while offering a wide selection of products. From lunch items, fresh fruit and produce (in the Autumn, the apple selection is one of the most thorough I've ever seen), Confections (great fudge), and baked goods, Atkins will cater to any and every that venture through it's doors.\n\nThe aforementioned cider donuts are a signature item of Atkins, and they're a must try. To describe them is difficult - they're delicious, though, and every time I've shared them with individuals who have never been to Atkins they're always impressed.  \n\nIf you're a fudge junkie, they've a large selection in the store that ranges from traditional to adventurous. All are home made and richer than rich. When it comes to the things Atkins sells, you can tell quite a bit of pride and effort goes into their products.\n\nIn and of itself, a visit to Atkins is an experience that goes hand and hand with a New England Autumn. Even if one is driving from halfway across the state, couple a visit to Atkins with a day at local Pumpkin Farms. Once you've had the combination of a Cider Donut and a hot mug of cider from Atkins, it will become as inseparable a part of Massachusetts autumn as the cold air and the falling leaves.",

We definitely want to come back and try other dishes.  Our server was very attentive.  She said the chef will not do substitutions because he had a particular vision for each dish (or something like that), which is understandable, but on the other hand, does make it less user friendly and limit your choices if you have a food intolerance/allergy etc.  Also, the fact that they have agave sodas instead of the standard junk food sodas was great.",

The bar is nice and long and this location is much bigger than L5P which is nice. I know everyone raves about their tots and burgers....but I'm gonna go against that and say you've just got to order some chili. I had the veggie chili(really good with some hot sauce on top) and it came out with this mysterious slab of yellow that appeared to have been grilled. Well...don't be afraid...just eat it because that mystery slab is some mother effin delicious jalapeno corn bread. Sooooo good.",

I always finish wanting to get another one, but I can't both because of, well, my health, and because it's a little pricey. I wish I could comment on the rest of their menu, but honestly, I've never tried anything else! The chicken sandwich is too good to pass up. \n\nThey don't allow you to sit in the cafe unless you order food during lunch hours, which is understandably frustrating. This isn't a great cafe to study at (even during non-lunch hours, since it's quite cramped), but I enjoy it as a nice, clean, and consistently yummy place for lunch.",

First let me state if you like Italian home cooking, red sauce, courteous service Fred's is your place.  One coveat lunch and dinner service and ambiance are night and day.  There are huge lunch crowds from the Texas Medical Center and you have to place your order in line.  It is very noisy although you do get served promptly.\n\nIn the evening you feel like you are in an Italian trattoria.  It is quiet, there is pleasant music the waiters are very attentive.  You always get hot rolls and a nice house salad at Fredi's.  Their prices are very reasonable.  I love their eggplant parmagiana, the lasagna and the spaghetti  Sicilian which is a heavy dish served with Italian Sausage and meatballs.  Bring your appetite to Fred's!!!",

I thought that was really awesome, and I ended up loving the chicken sandwich I traded it for. \n\nThey have great hot dogs and burgers, and great deals if you have a Stand Card, which is free :) I also love the location, nearby a lot of cool little shops, etc. \n\nI will definitely be back when I'm in the area :)",

The ambiance is perfect, causual, funky, artsy-fartsy funness! \n\nThe food is amazing, I havent tried anything I havent loved! I am a cheese person, so the Brie Panini ROCKS my world, it has carmelized onions on it that are surprisingly perfect! And the turkey sandwich with gouda, SO GOOD and classic! The vegan quesidilla is my new favorite, dont order it if you arent a mushrooms love tho! \n\nMy only complaint is that thier happy hour specials suck, so this tends to be my day time hot spot- I'd love to change that tho with the right motivation!",

So happy!\n\nJust as the UES location the food is incredible and reasonably priced. I love the shrimp tacos, the chorizo tacos, as well as the lengua! For sides definitely go with the quinoa y frijoles. And for starters the gorditas or the crab abs corn cakes are superb! For drinks, either go with agua frescas or the pomegranate hibiscus margarita. Awesome! And try the ancho spiced hot chocolate. So good!\n\nThe service is friendly and the atmosphere is nice. The UWS location has a nice outdoor area and a decent amount of space.",

But to provide some perspective, lots of college campuses don't offer nearly as much selection (they have fresh produce!), so I'm thankful to have Verdes around.  \n\nThey have a pretty good selection of drinks, although it's not quite as good as it was a few years ago.  The breakfast sandwiches are very good and are very reasonably priced--you can get a drink and sandwich for only $3!  Be sure to ask them to cook the egg on the grill rather than the microwave (if you don't say anything, you'll end up with some crusty eggs).",

Upon proper heating it was very good. The salad was good as well not exceptional but novel and tasty. The bread basket they brought was largely dissappointing also. The tapanade was delish but the breads themselves were not very good. The entrees were just ok- classic bolognese and gnocci with walnuts and gorgonzola.

The sweet-and-sour chicken was heavy and tough, plus it had a total turn-off of maraschino cherries in it. \n\nWe had hoped this place would be as good as the similarly named Panda North Restaurant in Brattleboro, VT, which is excellent, but it's not even in the same league.\n\nMuch later that same day -- we were about done in digestively by our meals.

The cooks are merely cooks.  All they need to do is throw  your food onto a hot surface with a *large* splash of oil and there you have it: The Real Greasy Chow Baby.\n\nIf you do find yourself stuck here with a group of friends, STICK TO THE SUGGESTIONS.

Their variety of flavors includes the creamy, the fruity, and the exotic. The fruit and candy toppings also makes a nice little addition to your yogurt cup. The place is always clean and is a great place to bring out-of-town visitors. My mother keeps asking about this place and is hoping that one would come the PNW.

Lunch is an exceptionally good deal. When you sit down they give hot and sour soup (wimpy), spiced peanuts, pickled cabbage with peppers and tea. The lunch special combos are not particularly Taiwanese, they are more generic  fare you would see in just about any Chinese restaurant in greater Boston. The list of lunch special contains a few gems like Octopus with dry bean curd, but you really need to go over to the regular menu to eat Taiwanese proper. I can't be sure but the chili oil looked like it was made/mixed on the premises, it was better than average. The also have the black vinegar but you have to ask for it.

Last Saturday we randomly happened to visit on account of our regular hangout Oliver's (Naturals) being closed and the market was lacking Thunder Mountain Curry, thinking gosh, where can we eat? \nThen we ran into some friends who invited us out to Carmen's on 1st street. Awesome!\n\nI was a little disappointed, I hate to admit, upon walking in. The space is neat and I liked the atmosphere. But gosh - open a window. It was sweltering in there and it was only 60 something degrees outside. I felt seriously uncomfortable and hot, which is not want you want to feel when ordering food. I ordered an iced coffee, but they were out of ice. Boo.\n\nOnto the food. I ordered Cuban Eggs, scrambled, which comes with plantains, avocado, rice & beans. Husband ordered Veggie Empanadas (thank you honey!) which also came with rice & beans and plantains. All of which sounded delicious. \n\nIt was all fresh, and nicely prepared, and very pretty and colourful, but I found a lot of things lacking.  The rice and beans were separate and the rice was... white. And plain. I sort of expect rice and beans to be combined and seasoned somehow. The plaintains and avocado were yummy  - but it's also hard to screw up cooking that.\n\nHusband's empanada (he knew I would steal at least *one*) was nice, but also a bit boring. I actually put hot sauce on most of my food, which I never do. The coffee was just meh. The kind of coffee I get in any generic diner.\n\nI should mention for serious vegetarians that they do prepare meat & veggie foods on separate equipment.\n\nI *really* wanted to love Carmen's, but there's nothing special there to draw me back. I think back in the day when Carmen ran the place, it probably was quite special.",

I've been in Princeton for three and half years and can honestly say I've tried every sushi restaurant on or near Nassau, and this place is great.\n\nWhen I first sit down, I'm always provided with a hot disposable handtowel. I usually ask for hot water to drink, and that comes with another glass bottle for refills which they fill whenever it's low. The same refill bottle is available if you order tea.\n\nI'm a large fan of their tuna and salmon rolls and sashimi. I'm a picky eater so the variety I try there is pretty limited, but their sashimi is fresh and delicious, and their spicy rolls are not over-mayonnaised or overly spicy.\n\nThe dishware is beautiful, and the food servings are always tastefully arranged. The menu also pretty much has all kinds of common Japanese food, and since the other great Sushi place in Princeton (Ajihei) went sushi/sashimi-only, this is a good place to take someone who's not as comfortable with the idea of eating all fish for a meal.\n\nThe atmosphere is warm and quiet, the staff is very friendly. They might get a bit full on Friday and Saturday nights, but usually you're seated immediately. Splitting a bills is also easy since they can do it for you.\n\nI've lived in Japan for a while and I still don't feel like MoCMoC has bad sushi at all. I also go to MoCMoC at least once a month, and I've never had a bad experience there.",

The dim red light emanating from the 2nd story window was like an obscure symbol for temptation in a David Lynch movie. I straight up felt like I was part of Inland Empire.\n\nOn greeting the hostess, I remained extremely optimistic because the house staff seemed so cool and hip and friendly--it seemed like the perfect bar.\n\nHere's my issue with the Red Fez:\n\"No substitutions.\"\n\nNow, I understand why some places refuse substitutions--it makes cooking more straightforward especially if short staffed, it leads to quicker processing, and it upholds the integrity of the cook's selection of ingredients. But no substitutions at the Red Fez means no changes... WHATSOEVER. No mayo on the side, no holding of mustard, and no \"light\" on the hot sauce.\n\n\"I'm sorry... what?\"\n\n\"I literally can't get this burger without mustard?\"\nOkay... my second choice entree...\n\n\"I can't go light on the hot sauce?\"\nOkay... my third choice entree...\n\n\"I can't just get some extra mayo on the side???\"\nOkay... there are only 2 more entrees on the entire freaking menu.\n\nI ended up getting the mac and cheese which wasn't bad... but I really just wanted a burger without mustard...\n*Shrug*\n\nI guess it's my fault. I'm a picky eater. But if a restaurant only has 5 entrees a night and won't even hold my mustard, I'm not sure I can rely on it to provide me an entree I actually want vs. an entree I'm settling for. And for that reason, I don't think I'll be going back. For a good bar, I'll be at the Avery. And for my burger without mustard, I'll be at Harry's.",

Maybe the colder weather will be keeping people inside more and that will mean more time to get a new pet transitioned into your home *hint *hint* \n\nYears ago I adopted a kitten from here. Little black kitten.. the feistiest one of the bunch :) Well, it's been about 6yrs, she's still fiesty, a fan of cuddles, and also a very solid member of our family. When we got her she had an upper respiratory issue, just something that happens once in awhile. Figure she was found with her little family outside so she didn't get the best start. The shelter offered to take her back, but even after just a couple days we were in love with her. The staff sent us home with helpful instructions, things to help feed her and medicine.. all free. She got better fairly fast and today is healthy, strong and can pretty much climb walls. Our vets wall still carries her nail marks today from when she tried to reach an impossibly high window! \n\nThat winter we also got Sophie as a companion for Edie. While the two didn't end up hanging out as much as I'd have liked, they always sleep together and always have each others backs when another cat creeps into our yard. Even tho the local cats just come to bake on the walkway when it's sunny out and aren't looking for any Edie or Sophie trouble. Nice to know the yard has four-legged security!  \n\nMy last visit to the shelter wasn't such a happy one. One of my dogs had passed away and I brought him over to be cremated after my vet told me that was there they sent animals. I chose a private cremation so that I could have the remains back. It was a difficult time for me but the staff was very sensitive and helpful.\n\nDuring that last visit I took a walk through where they keep the cats. Most were keeping it cool and relaxing, some were ready to play catch the finger through the cage. Some wanted to be pet and then pet some more. \n\nI then visited where the dogs were. Almost every dog perked up, most coming to the front of their little areas. Excited to see someone, tails wagging, tongues hanging out making that one track mind face that shows thoughts of \"pet me, pet me\" \"let's play\" or \"ooh ooh a visitor\". \n\nAs I walked out of the room, heads went to the floor, backs turned to the room so they could look out their windows and some just curled up looking a bit spent or perhaps let down. It was genuinely sad.\n\nIf you have the space, some extra time, and love to give that's pretty much all the animals here are looking for. Well that and maybe a treat or two and some room next to you so that they can be close to someone that loves them :)",

She doesn't know how to cut hair. She cut it exactly how I told her NOT to cut it. Her personality leaned more towards the chilly side, which I dont mind, but at least know hot to cut hair if youre a stylist. It was really disconnected. From my shortest layers (which are chin length) to the bottom length of my hair (mid back). Its top heavy and i barely had any volume at the length of my hair. Unfortunately, I can't do anything but wait for it to grow out again. Ladies, if you've ever had this type of cut, get a new stylist!!! And post about it on Yelp. These people should not be cutting hair.",

Anyway, hot pastrami, goats cheese, tomato, lettuce. It came with some coleslaw and a pickle. I could have eaten a few more pickles. The sandwich was good. You know, not Jewish deli pastrami, but definitely hit the spot. Owned by the same family as The Hungarian Pastry Shop next door. You can take your sandwich next door and eat there, too the lady said. Nice people and nice to support a local business. I'll be going back.",

The only DOWNSIDE to Grafton Street is their atrocious house Bloody Mary mix, which Paul has countered with his own homemade creation which I must say is out of this world.

Overall the burrito tastes fine it's just nothing to write home about.\n\nIt is worth the money though! The burritos have a lot of meat(no rice) and are quite filling for the $6 I spent. \n\nI think the best thing about fuzzys is their hot sauce! I DROWNED MY BURRITO IN THAT STUFF!

It's basically a small brick one-story storefront with a single sign that becons you with big-bold-back-lit letters reading \"hummus\".  \n\nGiven the stark exterior,  stepping inside reveals a pleasant surprise. The interior is nicely decorated with warm colors and trendy furniture. It's a very clean and comfortable atmosphere. Most importantly, though, the food is pretty good. I'm no expert on middle eastern food, but I do know what I like and I've never been let down here. It's a good alternative to the UPenn food carts; a little more expensive, but in my opinion, a step up in quality. The staff is always friendly and you won't have to wait long for your food. I recommend it. \n\nOh, and if they ask you if you want hot sauce, say yes!",

What a great place. Seems more authentically Mexican than Tex-Mex (i.e. I didn't think that I would have a heart attack from the Tex-Mex required lard that I love). \n\nThe portions are so huge that I wished I were a teenager again.

Along I got a stiff sangria for $5.95. The place is very charming with decorated paddles all over the place. It's small too. On a weeknight around dinner time it was getting packed.

I was first introduced to sushi at Nippon (which was later replaced by Nara on Westheimer) more than 15 years ago by my Japanese friend. I could not believe I would ever learn to love to eat raw fish...but Toro is my favorite!\n\nThey have another location in the Rice Lofts in Downtown and I have heard that they will be opening a third location in Rice Military off of Washington. The Downtown location has an outdoor seating area that is really great for entertaining.\n\nAzuma was the first to introduce hot rock beef in Houston, which can now be found at many Japanese restaurants throughout the US.  Also, the sashimi is served over a bowl of crushed ice, which keeps the fish cool as well as pleasant to the eye.",

It still looks a lot like the former restaurant Pangea, but I'm sure it will take on its own style soon.  My one piece of advice is to put some some picnic tables outside where you can get messy with the food.  \n\nTheir signature dish is the half-rack of ribs.  You can order them either wet or dry.  I was with a friend so we got both.  \n\nWe were pleased with both.  The sauce is sweet and spicy.  Meat was tender.  \n\nIf you need extra sauce they are more than happy to provide a pretty good pepper sauce as well as a selection of both homemade and bottled hot sauce.\n\nDecent sides include slaw, collards, corn cakes, etc.  Cornbread was a little dry.  But overall good selection.  \n\nThey have a great bar with tons of local beers to choose from.",

The room was small but well-appointed, complete with Keurig coffee maker and wonderful art.  There was no a/c, but the high 40 degree outside temperatures compensated.  Getting ready in the early morning with the draft coming into the bathroom from under the door was downright chilly.  Showering was challenging, as the water temperature would not stay constant--either scalding hot or too cold.  Walls were thin, but that was to be expected in a historic building. The restaurant downstairs, Henry's, served a wonderfully satisfying brunch, and the window seat was much appreciated.  \n\nI left my cell phone charger in the room, and hotel staff was not able to find it 14 hours after I checked out.  Thanks to Will Jones, GM, all was rectified in a timely and classy manner, and I will be booking the Hotel Durant during the next Spring Break.  Go Bears!",

Also, the tempura is $1 per piece, which is a little high.  In all, it was an ok meal in a cute location, but there are many better places to eat in the city.",

I also tried their hot wings and they tasted like Applebee's, which aren't the best either. And their Washington Apple Martini didn't taste like apples at all, it tasted like those nasty cherry liquid cough medications that many of us used to take when we were little kids. They don't have the cheapest happy hour, but I guess if you have a group of people who just wanna get together and chill somewhere close to the UW campus, then you can settle for this place.

It was either an early dinner or a late late lunch but I sat down to an empty restaurant after ordering a Chile relleno dinner, lengua taco and a large horchata.  \n\nThey started me out with some chips... and these were fresh and warm (exactly how I like them).  The salsa bar they have has a good variety but I have to be honest I am a wimp when it comes to too hot of salsas... and they had some hot ones.  \n\nThe Chile Rellenos was very tasty and came with rice, beans and tortillas.  The owner told me that they use quite of bit of cheese on their recipe... no complaints from me on that.  The Horchata was refreshing and they told me that it was made there.\n\nBefore I came here I was told by a friend that the food was good but he wasn't sure about the meat.  I didn't understand him at first as I thought one of the staples of Mexican food was good meat, and how could he think that the food was alright when a foundation wasn't solid.  After tasting the lengua taco I kind of understood where he was coming from the meat was very tough and seemed to be deep fried.  I am not sure about whether it was the timing (going the off hours) or something else but I wasn't impressed with the meat in the taco.\n\nHow does it all add together?  The main dish and drink was good, the service was excellent but the taco did leave me wondering.  I will return to try this place again, I think it will rise to my expectations.",

                    "text": "Months ago I got an insider tip that Al's was expanding into Harvard Square, which I can get to on my lunch break. I was ecstatic. Al's State Street Cafe has been one of my favorite local lunch venues for a very long time, and not having one nearby has been one of the few frustrating things about working in Cambridge. After checking time and again, I finally saw it today. Al's Harvard Square Cafe has opened. \n\nIf you've ever been to Al's State Street, you already know what to expect, but for those of you who haven't, here you go: \n\nExpect some chaos. Al's is loud. There is a constant din of customers and employees loudly calling orders back and forth. When it is busy, it's hard to tell which customers are waiting to order, which have ordered and are waiting to pay, and which have paid and are waiting for their sandwiches. There aren't lines so much as there are nebulae of people slowly weaving their way through each other. The chaotic nature is the only thing that takes a star off for me, and even then just barely. \n\nThe sandwich menu is simultaneous elaborate and simple. While there is a large selection of cold and hot subs, with many options for mixing and matching ingredients, you don't have to worry at all about price. Larges (which live up to their name) cost $7.50, and smalls $5.50, made with fresh ingredients and bread baked in-house. The prices are the same no matter what you order or how many (or few) ingredients you ask them to stuff into that delicious pocket of crusty bread. \n\nAs for the sandwiches, there isn't anything I've ever tried at an Al's that I didn't like. The eggplant parm, the chicken pesto, the cafe special (prosciutto, mozzarella, tomatoes and basil) and the lady cafe special (the cafe special without the prosciutto) have always been standouts for me. The lady I got for lunch today was as good, if not better, than ones I've had on State Street, and the scent wafting from eggplant parm I got for dinner had my mouth watering, too. \n\nOne thing that may be confusing and add to the chaos early on is the layout. They take orders for cold subs and assemble them on the left side, while taking orders for the hot subs on the left. However, the giant overhead menu has the hot subs on the left and the cold on the right. In the short time I was inside, I saw several customers confused by that, and I hope they switch them around. \n\nThe new location is in the Holyoke Center in Harvard Square. If you aren't looking for it, you may not find it, as it isn't visible from the street. I'm hoping this doesn't hurt the Cafe's ability to survive in Cambridge, because I plan to go here all the time. Thank you Al, for bringing your delicious subs up closer to my neck of the woods!",

(I opted for tempeh cause I bought it once before at TJ's and it wasn't horrible.)\n\nSince they were out of tempeh, Alanna behind the counter kindly suggested the Super Italian Meatball Sub ($7.95). (side note: she's great.) I was hesitant to try their seitan sausage meatballs at first. At first glance, you could easily mispronounce it Satan. And the words dry, chalky, and artificial came to mind. \n\nBooooooy-ho-hoy was I wrong. (insert eye roll here.) \n\nThe hot sub was all toasty and buttered up like... I dunno, a hot buttery french roll. Four good sized seitan meatballs lavished in caramelized onions and roasted sweet peppers, finished off with ribbons of fresh parsley. If you married the standard sausage meatball with a Japanese potato croquette, and crumbled in a few chunks of soft breadcrumb for luck, these seitan meatballs would be the baby. I felt like the ramen girl bobbing for ramen as I was taking bite after bite. The spread of pumpkin seed pesto and homemade vegan ranch dressing, mixed with the Italian of all Italian seasonings had me at a loss of words. Can I please please please learn the culinary art of vegan cuisine, too?\n\nI also ordered the Lavender Lemonade ($2.50). But before that, I asked if I could sample their 3 original recipes before I made my decision, and Alanna was more than happy to offer me a sample cup to sample the drinks. \n\nNative Iced Tea: a simple iced tea, not too sweet\nWatermelon Fresca: crisp, refreshing watermelon juice\nLavender Lemonade: a fresh batch of lemonade with just enough floral essence to let you know that something's there (It was also the sweetest of the three, by far. curse my darn sweeth tooth...)\n\n*Free drink for signing up for Native Foods Cafe Loyalty Program! yay! Free refills! double yay!\n\nI gave Native Foods 4 stars, but I wouldn't be surprised if on my next visit or two (or 10), I bumped it up to a 5. I'm beyond ecstatic to try their different menu items... but at the same time (still) skeptical. \n\nAlso, I asked one of the waitstaff about WiFi, apparently they don't have an official one. Would be something to consider? \n\nSo now America, with these finals words, I say onto you... I heart seitan.",

I don't know if it's because I'm not from Atlanta, aren't a \"peach,\" and haven't been in Atlanta long enough to drink the proverbial Kool-Aid...but I just don't get the infatuation with the Varsity. I know it's an institution, world's largest drive-in, yada yada. However, I just do not get the hype. \n\nMy husband and I ate at the Varsity, on our very first trip to determine if Atlanta would be our new home or not, after hearing it was the place to eat at from an Atlanta forum.  I was super excited about eating here after I read about the famous hot dogs, the history, and the \"What'll ya have?\" \n\nMy first impression as we drove up: \"This is it?\" Yeah, uhm so this is the world's largest driven-in restaurant?! Not impressed. Anyways, I put my snootiness aside and went on in. My next impression: \"Is this place clean?\" So, that should have been my clue there when the inside dining room was looking a little in need of some freshening. However, I've ate in worse places. Hello, I'm from Southern California. Ever heard of a roach truck?! Yeah, you get the picture now. So, I figured let's not judge the place, let me judge the food. I need to stop listening to myself. \n\nWe ordered chili hot dogs, onion rings, and a chili hamburger. Just the thought of it now makes me slightly queasy. They were the worst chili dogs I have in my life. In fact, the whole meal was the worst I have ever had from any establishment. Well, except for that place on the way back from Vegas. But, that's another story. \n\nThe food was cold and just overall blah. How do you even serve someone cold chili dogs? Like who does that?! I was so disappointed in my meal that I ended up giving my husband my food after a couple of bites. Something I never do. Mind you, my husband will pretty much eat anything and believes wasting food is almost a sin. My husband said, \"I would have thrown it away if I hadn't been so hungry.\" Yeah Varsity that's how bad you are. \n\nAs far as the service, well let's just say it was as cold as the food. I didn't even get my, \"What'll ya have?\" Bummer.",

Of course when you're here, you've got to stop by Splash. Pismo with no Splash is like Christmas with no Santa. Everyone should at least come here once and experience Splash Cafe! In addition I heard that costco is carrying their clam chowder so you have the same thing at home! *looking at my local costco\n\nParking is so horrible in Pismo. Traffic is bad. During the summer, not only is there college kids and locals but there's all of central california vacationing and I noticed an increased amount of foreigners speaking different languages this time down there.\n\nPrepare to wait in line... for a while!\n\nOur Order:\n-- Clam Chowder Bread Bowl: Yum! It's classic. The top and inside of the bread bowl are grilled with butter and are ready for you to dip into your piping hot bowl of clam chowder. Did I mention that it's the BEST? Yes it's super creamy and has a lot of potatoes and clams. I added some pepper and oh boy! I will say that Splash does something special because every bite is hot until the last bite in the bread bowl. How do they do this? Magic, I tell you.\n\n-- Clam Chowder Bread Bowl with Seafood Topping: $1 more for seafood topping?! The GF loved the extra crab and shrimp! \n\n-- Fish & Chips: Oh the fish and chips were pretty good but half of it was a bit soggy and kind of made it sad. The crispy fish was delicious. Also in general it's very FRESH! The curly fries SUCK! They have NO SEASONING?! Are you serious?! I had to drench them in ketchup to SAVE THEM! The tartar sauce was good with the fresh fish. \n\nI'm still giving this place 5 stars because it's classic and their claim to fame is still their clam chowder. They said they made something like 10 million gallons of clam chowder last year in their small kitchen in pismo, and that's ridiculous!

In an attempt to duck into a restaurant for a drink and a bite, my husband and I decided to have some tapas.\nI think the first thing that had me raise a brow was the chimichuri. It was wonderful and paired with my sangria (which cost way to much for the shot glass they served it in) I found myself eager to peer at the menu. We quickly chose 3 of the restaurant top picks and then I realized there were no salt and pepper shakers on the table. Nooo! For obvious reasons I soon got a little aprehensive on the upcoming plates. \nFirst dish out was the Patatas Verde which sadly enough needed more seasoning but you could tell they were really fresh potatoes and a nice creamy sauce. The Gambas al Ajillo came out next, it was simple fresh shrimp, nothing too special, but exactly what I was expecting. Last the  Pinchos de Pollo which was a standard kabob with pollo. It came with pretty good but dry safron rice. \nThe atmosphere was fun and as each dish came out it was fun to share and talk about each one. I would go for another tapas place if I had the choice but its a great time and the location is convenient if you find yourself in the Rice Village.",

I tried the fennel salad with fresh berries and mandarin orange and a cup to tomato bisque with a piece of focaccia.  All tied together with a nice hot chai.  The highlight of the meal was the soup and the bread.  The tomato bisque was rich and creamy and the focaccia was warm and well seasoned.  The combination was to die for.  The soup is very well priced.  $3.50 for a cup including the bread.  Try finding that deal many other places in Harvard Square!  The chai was decent, but seemed slightly watered down.  I'd probably go for an espresso based drink next time.\n\nSo now the reason for the three stars.  The service.  Maybe I'm just overly sensitive to customer service, but I feel my rating is justified.  When I placed my order, the woman was very rude with an \"it's not my job to answer your questions\" type attitude.  I believe a few eye rolls may have been in there as well.  Also, I ate at Crema right after the dinner rush.  There were no clean table to sit at.  In the end, I had to share a table with someone else's dishes and utensils.\n\nI see that others have had really great experiences. I loved the food so I will probably try it out again.",

Plus it's in PG Plaza, the big hotspot for crime in Hyattsville. So one of the big pros of this gym, that it's conveniently located within easy walking distance of my place (and metro accessible), is somewhat offset by the fact that it's probably not very safe to walk here after dark. Their selection of classes is pretty good, but why oh why do most take place between 10AM and 5PM?\n\nOverall, I'm glad to have this gym in my neighborhood, and technically they can't do much about how crowded it is after work, but if a competing gym were to open up nearby, I would definitely consider switching.",

Any more than that and it seems they freeze the kitchen until an entire order is out, so parts of it might be particularly cold, and may take over an hour and a half to deliver.\n\nThe beer selection at this location is top notch.  They regularly rotate some great microbreweries and, after being a Master's, I still get a beer education every time I go.\n\nBeer prices are reasonable -- and it's Taco Mac, so it's all about the beer.  Food is pretty typical, slightly more upscaled than a dive joint bar food.  Stick to the wings and the queso (I know, carb/fat bombs) -- you really can't miss.\n\nOn this particular visit, I dined with co-workers during lunch.  I had a Dogfish Head 90 minute on draft (my favorite of beers at the moment), a six pack of hot wings with celery, and a water.  Service was consistent, food was what I expected.  Yes, that means it's A-OK.\n\nParking is validated for I believe the first hour -- after that, it runs about 3 bucks an hour.   If you're smart and it's during certain hours (read: not during morning and evening rush hour), there's top secret parking along Juniper that's free.",

The ambiance is very much casual and a great place to chill with a group of friends or possibly a fantastic place to stop by after a date night. Unfortunately, the downside is the interior, the walls are painted in a tangerine-like color and it's very distracting. But not so much the interior but the quality of the food is what it's about! I'm from LA and if I've learned anything from going out and checking out different restaurants and hot spots, I have realized that it's always the dankiest places that have the best food.

Its location is really inconspicious; the building is more well-known for Stan's Donuts, which has far out-lived all of its co-occupants. \n\nFor the most part, it's a rather small restaurant. Fast food that reminds me heavily of Gushi and the teriyaki bowls from Taisho back home. For what you get, it's rather pricey; the price was rather disappointing for the quantity. I also found it annoying that to add veggies cost me more money, since they were just broccoli and carrots. \n\nI ordered a Half and Half bowl (half chicken, half beef). The chicken was actually pretty good, decently juicy without feeling like there was too much oil. The beef wasn't quite as satisfying; the pieces were smaller and the taste was slightly saltier. They also offered hot sauce and a \"magic sauce\" to add to your meal. The \"magic sauce\", from what I could taste, was just a less salty teriyaki sauce.\n\nAll in all, the $5 chicken bowl + reg. drink deal is pretty good, and the people working there are quite nice. For a more thoroughly satisfying meal, however, I'd just go to Gushi a few blocks down. It costs more, sure, but I'd rather take the increase in quantity and quality for a few dollars more.",

They deliver ( it's nice when you're confined in your house because its raining, or simply, you're just too damn lazy to leave your house, or both). \n\n2). Not only do they deliver food, they deliver coffee/lattes to you (again, if you're too lazy to get some...you get the point).\n\n3). They have a large menu of things to order from: hot and cold sandwiches, different types of bread to choose from, wraps, soups, ice cream and yogurt, smoothies and more...\n\n4). You can get olive pate on your sandwich--yum.\n\nNow for it lacks a little...:\n\n1).   If you like meat but not want to eat/taste more meat then bread on your sandwich, this not is the place for you. I hate it but I will still order from them. The annoyance will endure when you have to take out the meat with your fingers. One might qualify this as sheer laziness but, still, its more annoying then laziness...\n\n2). The latte is not that great (but if you're lazy too go out and buy one-- the latte is not Starbucks).\n\nAll and all, this place is \"orderable\". They seem to use fresh ingredients  in the sandwiches and wraps. They have olive pate--who does that! Love it. And its not nasty Chinese delivery that probably has MSG in the food.",

Why do I want a mango?\" *insert confused look here*\n\nOf course we exit Prego and I'm like \"Ohhhhh...\" and we joke about wanting a purple banana next time. I immediately mention my love for Yogurtland, but she insists that this is the best fro-yo EVER.\n\nIt's her treat, so I tell her to choose everything. I was ready to self-serve my toppings, but realized there was a glass... anyways the prices seem a little high for toppings and they gave us like 8 raspberries.  There are additional choices of smoothies or parfaits, too. \n\nI think as a foodie fattie, I still have loyalties towards self-serve and cheap Yogurtland. Red Mango looked like they only had maybe 5 flavors to choose from? I didn't pay too close of attention.  \n\nLocation makes it a great place to drop by after a hot afternoon of shopping or when you can't really afford the dessert at a nearby restaurant and opt for lower calories :).",

I had the truffled french fries as an appetizer. They were delicious, hot and crispy, just the way fries should be. For my main course I went with the truffle pizza. The crust was perfect and the toppings couldn't have been more delicious. I wanted to try the pumpkin-bay pots de cr\u00e8me, but they were all out. The second visit was just for dessert and after dinner drinks. The late harvest Riesling was sweet, but not too cloying. The rustic pie and coconut milk ice cream left something to be desired. The pie was ice cold and was way too tart. The ice cream tasted like chalk and was just plain yucky. Luckily my husband was more than happy to eat the entire thing. He hates to waste food:-) On both occasions the service was attentive without being annoyingly so. Overall, I'd say stick with just drinks and pizza, as those seem to be the items that are most reliably good.",

Basically, you pay $3 for lettuce, and then a seemingly random price for each topping.  You can get a lot of things--eggs, garbanzo beans, tomatoes, marinated mozzarella, artichoke hearts, etc--but you have to sit there and decide, \"Are cucumbers worth 85 cents?  Is something wrong with the sliced egg that it's only 25 cents?\"  Which is, honestly, annoying.  Plus you have the cashier waiting impatiently for you to decide. And after all that, my salad was small!  I got maybe 4 pieces of mozzarella, for example.\n\nMy friend got a hot sandwich, and it looked both small in size from a bird's eye view, as well as a little scant on the filling.  I'd guess that with a Revive sandwich, you get about half of what you get elsewhere (Amer's, say).\n\nWe split a raspberry bearclaw.  I don't believe what we were given was either raspberry or a bearclaw.  Still, it was good.  Maybe not $3 good, though.\n\nThe staff was a little curt, the place a little disheveled (their giant balsamic vinegar, for example, had maybe 1 tbsp's worth left in it).\n\nUpsides: there is outside seating, free cold water, and a nice selection for vegetarians.",

Flavor was perfect and authentic with spice level 3 of 5. \nIf you're looking for a real party in your mouth, try the spicy noodles. The flavors are amped up x100... sweeter, saltier, spicier! Amazing for like a quarter of the dish but the pad thai wins out on eating-longevity (that is, can eat more of it in one sitting).\nOk, the place is a hole-in-the-wall, probably not very sanitary. Yeah, the staff rushes you even at 5pm on a Sunday afternoon in between semesters at UW so nobody was waiting in line. I don't care. Their noodles are perfect and the whole ambiance reminds me of those cramped food stalls in Asian markets that I have such fond memories of.",

I headed inside and got the breakfast croissant, which was delicious, seemed to be made fresh, and warm. They also have $1.50 bags of loves of bread in front of the counter and I picked up a bag of cheese and herb bread, which was delicious toasted! Can't beat the price either. The servers were very friendly, and it seems to be family owned and operated - there was an older woman in the back making drinks/food, and a young guy and girl at the counter ringing people up.\n\nThe atmosphere is really nice and quiet, had good music playing. My one complaint is that I stood waiting for my croissant for a good ten minutes. They could definitely pick up on the speed, but then again, they seemed busy as several people came in after me to order coffees or whatnot.\n\nAlso, my coworker claims the homemade soup is delicous, and I saw the sandwhich she ordered once and it was huge!",

What a pleasure.\n2) That garbage that's all over the parking lot is really nice, especially when I'm hungover and feel like someone donkey-kicked me in the head.\n3) Is the line really that long?\n4) Why is this taking so long?  I could have grown my own bagel tree by now.\n5) What haven't they run out of?  \n6) You'd think that running the computer system requires a PhD from how long it's taking to ring my bagel up.\n7) This tastes like it's been microwaved.... And only has sesame seeds on one side.\n\nThis morning I discovered The Hot Bagel Shop on Shepherd.  My recommendation would be to keep driving right on past Einstein Brothers and go there.",

However, in West Philly, this would be better than average Thai food. \n\nI would recommend their noodle dishes. They are a decent sized portion and quite flavorful. I wish they were able to make their dishes a bit spicier though. \n\nTheir curry dishes are okay. The curry itself is great and they give you a good deal of it. However, the meats and vegetables are a bit below average. The chicken that I had was a bit overcooked. It also tasted a little bit like chicken that was in the freezer for too long. The portions of rice could also be improved, but they were happy to bring out another bowl of rice upon request that was in a much more decent-sized bowl.\n\nTheir desserts were great! I went with three other people, and we ordered two desserts between the four of us. We got one dessert with delicious coconut ice cream that was paired with fried bananas. My friends did not really like the fried bananas. They said it was a bit tart, and the texture was odd underneath the fried batter, but anything fried is good in my book. Besides, the hot-cold combination was good. The other dessert was the Chocolate Fantasy, which comprised of chocolate cake and some fruit. It was pretty good from what I heard.",

So to rectify this my wife and I decided to give Hawaii BBQ Restaurant a try.  Upon entering you notice a hot case to your right that contains what looks like an oversized sushi roll, except it's not fish strapped on to a brick of rice with seaweed, it's a slice of SPAM.  The other thing you'll hopefully notice is the menu which, if you're facing the counter, is behind you as one friendly patron pointed out to me.  Their menu is huge and looks to be evolving around a steady core of items, there are tacked on notes and pictures as new items are added. \n\nThe food itself seems to run along the lines of teriyaki style places but combined with some items from the mainland with a Hawaiian twist.  Many of the dishes consist of  meat sliced and grilled and then covered with some kind of sauce served over rice.  In this case though, instead of salty teriyaki sauce they have a few other sweeter choices.  They also have a good macaroni salad and my wife really digs the SPAM and Rice brick.\n\nThe food was slow to arrive on the night we went.  There seemed to be quite a few takeout orders ahead of us in the queue.  So, if you're on a schedule, it might not be the place to go.  However if you want some affordable food and gigantic portions, come on down!",

It is often served over lettuce and toasted flatbread, with certain herbs and sometimes onions.  A classic Middle Eastern or North African dish.\n\nDrinks selection is limited but they have basics such as Coke, Sprite, and chocolate milk.  Chips and dessert selection also limited.  But who cares, the real reason you come here is the warm & tasty main dish or wrap!\n\nTotally fair prices on the wraps, which are huge, and cheaper than nearby gourmet sandwich joints.

Their food is also pretty tasty, nothing extra special but good enough for the price and the atmosphere.\n\nBUT, heed my advice, skip sitting on the patio (even on a nice day) and in the dining room and head straight to the bar! Belly up at the counter and have a nice chat with Jason or Bobby. The house margarita is one of the best I've ever had (it actually ruined other margs for me) and they've got tons of fancy ones on the menu too, I highly recommend the Lychee or Watermelon. As for the purists, they have over 75 tequilas available for sipping, shooting or just admiring from a far.

Whenever I go there, I typically give the waiter the benefit of the doubt that s/he is new or something like that. But the service is so consistently bad that it can't be a coincidence. My guess is that they hire people on whether or not they are hipsters, not on their previous experience. Don't get me wrong - hipsters can be good waiters, but being a hipster doesn't necessarily make you a good waiter.",

I asked for an iced soy latte and got a latte in a small coffee cup with ice. Despite the odd container for an iced latte (in most places iced drinks are served in clear glasses, while hot drinks are served in mugs) the drink itself was actually really tasty, so who gives a hoot about how it's delivered as long it its tasty when it gets to my belly.",

Sadly, I will have to go back to sleep to find it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there's plenty to enjoy.  The location in Kerrytown offers plenty of outdoor seating, which we made the most of on our early September visit. I got level 4 out of 5 on the spice-o-meter, and it was perfectly hot yet still flavorful. Ingredients seemed fresh - big and firm.  Well, the veggies anyway.  The meat was generic low grade thai beef, but that's par for the course when it comes to cheap thai.\n\nExcept this isn't cheap thai.  My lunch was $8.50.  For Thai on plastic plates. In a fast food atmosphere (well, really good fast food, like chipotle). And why can't anyone ever give me enough rice?  Its cheap!  Give me an abundance! I don't know why I can't have an avalanche of rice on my plate!?!  OK that's probably just me.\n\nNo Thai! is acceptable if you're in the area and its nice outside and you'd like your nose to run a bit during lunch. But for a couple more bucks, I could have Tuptim, which is superior.  The dream lives on...",

Bagels are now more like magic to me than food, and Absolute Bagels is single-handedly responsible for my enlightenment. \n\nThe bagels are just so crusty and fluffy and hot and crust and yummy and--did I mention the crust is delicious? They have a ton of bagel varieties (my favorite is the whole wheat sesame) and an impressive assortment of cream cheese. The dutch apple cream cheese is so rich; it's really like eating pie innards on a bagel. The walnut raisin is also sweet and delicious. I am, however, partial to tofu cream cheese and Absolute has more varieties than any place I've been. Get the herb tofu! \n\nThe people who work there are really nice too. They know the regulars and are friendly to everybody. Plus they make a mean raspberry iced tea. \n\nThere are only two downsides to Absolute: the coffee is pitifully bad--so bad you might ask yourself, is this coffee that they gave me, or brackish water?--and it can be hard to get a seat if you want to eat there. But even these two inconveniences aren't enough to dissuade my love for Absolute!  Every other bagel really is just circular bread next to these pieces of heaven.",

I usually go for the 6\" sandwich and that fills me up right but opt for the 12\" ~$9 when im feeling monstrously hungry. If I'm feeling fat the chili cheese fries in my opinion are the best in Berkeley.\n\nBottom line:\nThere really isn't anything like this in Berkeley. But what I like best is, if you get no dressing, and no mayo, you really have a rather light cheese steak sandwich. IBs actually uses good quality meat with a lower fat content than many cheesesteak places, making for a tasty, cheesy sandwich that doesn't have you clutching your heart 30minutes after you finish eating. It's fast, convenient, friendly, and delivers exactly what the same thing time and time again; a good hot sandwich.",

Not long enough for a phone conversation or even a few texts. Keep it moving folks, get off that phone, you're up at the counter!\n\nAnd the people who work here are fast, efficient and friendly. They deserve big tips!\n\nOverall, good food, especially for the price. You'll end up finding a place in there to sit even if it doesn't initially look like it.

I don't typically seek salon services at large retail shops, but the Ulta circular advertising the OPI gel manicure for $25 sucked me in.  I decided to give it a shot . . .\n\nI had never gotten a gel manicure before and wasn't sure what to expect, but what I ended up with was not it.  The manicurist was nice enough, but was not very professional.  I got the feeling that she did not have much training and I didn't really feel like the conditions on/around the nail bench were very hygienic.  She also didn't really do that great of a job on my nails, as she got paint all over my skin/cuticles which was difficult to get off due to the fact that it was a gel manicure.  Our session was also interrupted by several of her friends that came into the salon seemingly just to \"chat.\"\n\nOn top of everything, I got my first chip less than 48 hours later!  I'm not sure who's to blame for that one - but aggravating nonetheless!

Not the best that I've ever had, but consistently good.  We had the mild, honey BBQ, Carribean Jerk and Hot BBQ and were happy with all of the sauces.

It is a quick walk up one flight of stairs.  \nOnce you get up there, it's has a nice reception area.  It's not a spa so don't expect the trickling water and chimes kind of thing. However, it is very pleasant and inviting. There are keyed lockers and a central  waiting area with a complimentary hot sauna.  I would suggest you go early to relax a bit before your massage.   There are also showers and private changing areas.  It was very quiet on a weekday afternoon. \nThe LMP I saw was David L. He is great.  Calling ahead is best, of course, but I was able to get a same-day appt.  I have to say it is SO nice to be able to squeeze in a massage when you really need one after a stressful day. \nAlso ask about the parking before you arrive. They have an arrangement with the pay lot behind Rite Aid.",

They have a wide variety of lunch type items to choose from, many different breads, and there is the bakery part.  I got half of a turkey and ham sandwich with cheddar on a french roll and their hot air fries to eat and a strawberry lemonade to drink.  Even getting the half size, I couldn't finish it.  Maybe other people can eat a huge half of a sandwich and a whole basket of fries, but I certainly couldn't.  I prefer reasonable portions.  It did taste good, but nothing super special or anything.  The strawberry lemonade was really good and a nice alternative to soda or iced tea.  \n\nThe one thing that wasn't too good was the lack of space during lunch.  Every single table was taken when I got there and I had to basically hover over someone as they were collecting their trash and things to secure one.  I was also alone so I couldn't cleverly send someone else to get a table while I ordered for us.  Maybe that says more about other people than the place and perhaps this is just the way it is in Pasadena, but I'm pretty sure they could do something to help.\n\nOverall, it wasn't stellar and I don't see it becoming a regular place I go, but the food was tasty.",

However, it took them 20 minutes to get my order ready - which is kind of long, in my opinion to get together broth, noodles, and the add-ins. But I was sitting in the leisure of my own space, so it didn't really bother me.\n\nI order the combination noodle soup. I was trying to find a dish similar to Thai style noodle soup, and this was very close. The packaging wasn't the best - the broth came in a cylindrical container and was tasty and very hot, the way it should be, and the rice noodles & bean sprouts came in a typical Chinese take-out container.. Not the most efficient way to eat noodle soup, but if I wanted to be treated like the princess I'm not, I would have just dined in and got waited on. Kind of overpriced, but needed a soupy noodle fix. Would come back if I had another hangover.. haha",

Sweet and spicy broth with delicious noodles, hefty chunks of tofu, and perfectly cooked vegetables. They call it medicine soup, and I believe it. I always feel better after I've finished my bowl.\n\nThe Cambodian coffee is unusual and flavorful (I recommend trying it hot rather than ordering the standard iced coffee variation that you can get at most Thai and Vietnamese restaurants), the appetizers are delicious, the menu is quite varied (featuring Cambodian specialties as well as dishes from other countries in Southeast Asia), the prices are reasonable, and the staff is super-nice. Eat in the tiny dining room or rent out the top floor for a banquet. (I know folks who have done both.) Just don't forget the nam yaa soup, whatever you do.",

What no one is telling you in the other reviews is that they are going or graduating from Johnson and Wales as a chef or in restaurant mgmt and they think they're hot stuff cause they know hot to fry an egg. The real deal is that when you weigh the experience, the location, the variety of food and wine and finally the quality of the food, this place is as good if not a little better. The place has been there longer than these snot noses have been alive. Valet parking, and a few steps down to a semi basement speak easy style restaurant. I hear they have bulletproof glass as well. I was sure to sit with my back to the wall. Our waiter and side flambe waiter had been there for 12 and 18 yrs, so no turnover is a good thing except when you're a snippy college kid who thinks you know it all. Give respect to get it. Secondly when you go to any good restaurant that's well established, try something that they are known for or some of the specials. Kobe Meatballs in pasta, grilled octopus, stuffed zucchini flowers lightly fried, rack of lamb, veal parm and i had the Osso Bucco. The Mom had the duck special . She was happy as a ^&**%%$..I tried , heck we all tried it and it was terrific. The Graduate ( from J&W) went for the steak diane served table side. Terrific Experience , even though the heavy peppercorn sauce was not to his cup of tea, but who are we to complain., He ordered it and it was made just right.. Back to my Osso Bucco...Perfect, from the marrow in the bone to the right amount of fat on the side of the meat. We were so stuffed from diner that we passed on Dessert. Ended up going for some Ben and Jerry's later in the night. As far as the wait staff , i can see why people may have an issue they are a family and it's a busy place. TRY SMILING AND HAVING SOME FUN AND LET DOWN YOUR HAIR and the staff is more than willing to please. FINALLY, a white linen restaurant and your bill is $150 for 4 people and no liquor??? I'd a thrown ya out the door and told ya to go to red lobster. \n\nCapriccio, whether you're Italian, in the mob, know someone in the mob or a fan of the sopranos, you'll enjoy.",

Very very hard to find parking but we were lucky and parked a few minutes away.\n\nLong line and the food came slow but the clam chowder was very delicious, creamy, not heavy and piping hot.

As we drink our coffees from compostable \"ecotainers\" and watch the crowds of people flock in and out of buildings on the hour, we enjoy the warm morning and our cordial conversations.\n\nWe arrived at 10:30 and there was no line as opposed to 10 and 11am when the line stretched out the door. The service is attentive and relatively fast (especially for opening day) and seems extremely friendly.\n\nStephanie W. enjoyed a cafe au lait and a chocolate almond biscotti in the morning, which was the perfect texture and just the right sweetness to complement the bitter complexities of her coffee. Kenneth R's cappucino was flawlessly made.  He thought that the barrista did an excellent job with the coffee (from McLaughlin http://www.mclaughlincoffee.com/).\n\nTony L. said that his iced coffee (made by pouring hot brewed coffee over ice cubes) was \"great!\"",

This time, I had the Tortilla Soup, which was unexpectedly deliciouso! It has a generous of grilled chicken pieces with a nice smoky flavor. The soup is nice and hot (temperature) with great spices, diced avocados, tortilla chips, shredded cheese and corn kennels. It was slightly tangy and has a good kick of spiciness. I have always been looking for good tortilla soup and the best I've tasted so far was during my trip to Costa Rica. This one is pretty near to the one I had in Central America. Muy Bien! \n\nMy friend had a Carnitas unwrapped burrito that was served in a bowl minus the flour tortilla wrap. The Carnitas bowl came with black / refried beans of your choice, Spanish rice, salsa, sour cream, a little shredded cheese and a very generous portion of stewed meat. This is an interesting concept especially for people who like my friend who likes burrito, but doesn't like the flour tortilla wrap. It definitely cut down some carbs without the wrap. \n\nThe prices are moderate, the restaurant is clean and spacious. It was a great little Mexican restaurant in the Stanford Shopping Center. We got our Mexican food fix without having to pay Palo Alto prices, if you know what I mean.",

It has a fun atmosphere, it's cheap, and the food is great.  I know it's a chain, but that's probably why it's so good.  Consistency, my friend.\n\nThe tortilla chips are made fresh in-house, and are still warm/hot when they get to your table.  They aren't too salty, and can be dangerous, because when your basket is empty, the bussers bring you another full one, and another...and another.\n\nThe margaritas are fabulous.  One turns into three pretty easily, but the house margarita is so cheap, you should have at least three anyway.\n\nMy favorite meals are the Blackened Catfish Fajitas, any of the fried catfish dishes, and surprisingly, the Eggplant Royale.  I love Cajun/Creole food, and that's what I go to the Border for.  There's better food out there, I'm sure, but I'm perfectly satisfied every time I go.\n\nThere is a server there, a Latina whose name I forget (she sort of looks like Salma Hayek) who is the best server I've had there.  I hope you are lucky enough to be assigned to her.\n\nHave fun!",

It's... JOY.  I always come out of this restaurant smiling because Samir has this positive energy about him that just uplifts your spirit (but of course the food helps a lot too cause I can be crabby when I'm hungry...)  \n\nI highly recommend the Gyro Sandwich or the Shawarma Sandwich if you're grabbing it on the go, but if you have time to stick around then order the Baba Ghanoush or perhaps even upgrade your sandwich to a platter.   Everything is good here especially since Samir will tailor your food to your liking by asking if you like onions, spices, and etc.  Since he makes it front of you, it is guaranteed your food will always be piping hot.  Samir takes very good care of you here and he makes sure that you are completely satisfied with your meal... he wouldn't have it otherwise.    \n\nYou can get a nice sandwich, a nice conversation with Samir, and a high dose of joy all for less than $5... hence why I keep coming back.   \n\nP.S.

We don't eat lamb curry, chicken tikka masala or have naan on the regular.  So for that, this place is awesome.  The food is very flavorful and very filling, the naan buttery and hot.  And free refills on the chai, good stuff.\n\nThe decor and apparent uncleanliness is something less desired, however, if you don't expect it to be clean, it doesn't take away from the eating experience.  I haven't had bad experiences such as the ones described here (band-aid under naan... ewww...); so I can't speak for that.\n\nWord of warning - if you have a weak stomach, drink lots of Maalox and/or eat Tums prior to and after eating your meal.  And you WILL permeate the scent of Chandini Chowk for the rest of the day, regardless of what else you eat or do.",

I also tried the Crispy Cuttlefish with salt yolk which I was very surprised by how good it was, I though it would be too salty but it was quite tasty. The service is always pleasant and now that they have their system down the wait time is very reasonable. Each dish is large so it is best to go with a lot of people and that way you can share many dishes. Looking forward to the next time I get to go.",

They also said the soup was ma-la (numbingly hot). So we ordered the special. But alas it arrived battered and light on the chilly. Yes, there were some fragrant chili spices but nothing verging on the level of spicyness we love. \n\nLong beans were OK but again not as spicy as we would like. Dumplings were the best dish of the night. Nice but not outstanding. Appreciate the fact they do have a vego option which a lot of places do not.\n\nSo we will continue to search for decent spicy Chinese food in Boston. Any tips greatly appreciated :-)",

You walk in and order from the counter, and your food will be delivered to your table.\n\nThe garlic rolls are hot, soft and heavenly.

I was here last night with friends and made to wait in a fictitious line to get into an empty hotel bar. HEEEELLLLLLOOOOOOOO?\n\nWhen we got to the hotel steps, I told the bouncer/idiot door attendant/wanna-be Hollywood hot-shot that we were meeting friends inside.  He leaned over and asked \"what event are you going to?\" - WTF does it matter? How bout the it's freak'n Friday and I'm gonna get trashed event ya prick? When I said \"i don't know what event there is - we're just meeting friends inside\" he nodded then took a step back and pretended we weren't there.\n\nSo, out came the cellphone to have our friends come fetch us.  As soon as she came out to get us, then he freed the ropes and let us up... and of course, no one was inside.  I could have played roller hockey in that place it was so empty. \n\nAnyway - that being said, ya-dee ya-dee ya-dee, i agree w/ everyone else to the extent that the drinks are your normal nothing special but the expensive $15 well drink price for the honor of being in such a splendidly (b/c it really is) decorated hotel.  This remodeled version is a 1000 times better then what it was a few years back.",

I've been going here since I first moved to Chapel Hill, and it's an absolute staple of life on or around campus.\n\nIt's a tiny hole in the wall place, kind of a cave, really (If you're tall, remember to duck when entering the main dining room).  The ambiance is fantastic, everything bright and gaudy and ridiculous, but very charming.\n\nStarting out with the complimentary chips and salsa is neat, mainly because there's a do-it-yourself salsa bar so everyone can pick their favorite from a half-dozen types of salsa.  I usually go for the enchiladas, which are excellent.\n\nA couple people I know complain that the food here is \"soupy,\" which is fair to an extent.  Occasionally everything will come out of as a shapeless mass of cheese and chicken so dense that light itself is trapped within.  That being said, things are hot and flavorful, everything that you'd really expect from low-class Mexican fare.\n\nBeware El Gigante.  It will destroy you.\n\nThe service is adequate at best, but again, that's to be expected.  Look elsewhere for beer specials.  Pay in cash and they enter you in a drawing to earn free food.  If you're looking to save cash, go for the A la carte selections on the back of the menu... there's a decent amount of food there for very little coin.",

Generations of residents have made a trip to The Custard as a rite of passage, a first date, or just to hang out. Located on the corner of Wallace and Main Sts. across the street from Columbian Park, it's easy to see how this walk-up ice cream stand has become a local gathering spot. Many stories abound about \"Granny,\" an elderly lady and matriarch of the owner's family who could be found at the cone window every summer until her death. She plays a major role in a local legend involving Axl Rose, Guns n Roses lead singer and Lafayette native. Besides custard ice cream, other local favorites include fruit drink and nut bars. Hot dogs, sandwiches, and other food items are also served there. Recently, the custard machines were replaced and some aficianados believe the consistency of the custard is not what it used to be.

Five Guys doesn't really deliver that for me.\n\nI got a \"little\" bacon cheeseburger - aka a normal sized burger - with cajun style fries.  The meat patty was good, bacon OK, but the bun was awwwwwful!  They wrap their burgers in foil and it makes the buns all mushy from the steam.  Even when you eat there, the buns get mushy... so I can't even imagine how bad it is if you order takeout.  For me, there's few things worse than a wet, mushy hamburger bun.\n\nThe cajun fries were OK.  Nice flavor, although I prefer shoestring.  I would be open to coming back just because Five Guys is right there in Westwood Village... maybe try out more of their menu like the hot dogs.  But I can't say I'm in love with their hamburgers...For this type of burger, you're better off going to Hole in the Wall or even the Stand.

Although I've had mixed experiences with Perks in terms of service (baristas who know what their doing versus those who are getting trained), the quality of their product always draws me back. Oh, and did I mention latte art?! When it isn't busy, the baristas will take extra care of you that way. \n\nHere are my recommendations: \n- Cubano: A unique way of preparing espresso, here they use demarara sugar to sweeten the espresso \n- Cafe Cacao: A Cubano added with unsweetened chocolate. Ask for a hint of cream. \n- Spicy Maya: Their version of a Mexican Hot Chocolate. They add chile powder which gives it a unique kick at the end of every sip. \n\nPerks also provides comfortable seating, so it makes for a great place to study or catch up with friends. On weekends, you can catch free swing dance lessons provided by UCSD students. Prices are reasonable, but I encourage everyone to bring their own mugs so that you can receive special discounts. \n\nOverall, Perks is a great place for that quick pick-me-up. I definitely recommend this coffee place on campus. Give their specialty drinks a try, I highly recommend the ones listed above.",

They give you a lot of food, although a lot amount of the quantity is rice.  Spices and sauces a generous enough to last the whole dish, and the sides of sprouts and kimchi are ok-ish.  I guess I just like that this place has absolutely no pretensions.  You pay, they cook, you eat.  \n\nInteriors are pretty much from the discount section at home depot.

Pretty bland, and it actually sort of reminded me of something I would have gotten during \"hot lunch\" in elementary school.

Just arugula and cheese, with a sauteed mushroom or two. \n\nMy friend got the margherita pizza, which I think Mani is known for, but it was also not that great.

I'll probably regret this later seeing that my fingers are a little oily, but it's worth it I'm sure.\n\nThe usual dishes - chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, etc. - are fine and dandy, as you can read in the rest of the reviews.  But I highly recommend you try the other fare as well.  I love the dal makhni and channa masala.    If you're not going for the buffet, try the makhni chicken - it's my absolute fave and almost compares to my Indian friend's mom's homemade.  On that note, all of my Indian friends love it here as well.  No, it's not the same as homemade, but it's pretty damn close.\n\nIf you love mango, go for a mango lassi or the mango ice cream.  The rest of the desserts are great, as well, but I find the mango ice cream to be refreshing at the end of this kind of meal.\n\nI tend to get delivery seeing as that I'm usually holed up in my room studying, and I've never had a problem with their delivery service - fairly prompt given the volume of people they serve, and always hot and fresh.",

I think you can also get 1 dollar hot dogs.\n\nWell one time my friends and I were going in to sit down and watch something and we saw and heard this rat skittering through the aisle.  It was amazing hilarious.  I wonder if I should have mentioned that?  I mean, this is an unalloyed positive review -- I think everything about this place is superb.  Even a few rats add character.

My dad got the green tabasco chicken, which was okay, but I'm not a huge chicken fan to begin with.  My mom got the fried green tomatoes, which seemed like a weird entree, but were the best I've ever had.\n\nI got some kind of banana pudding dessert, which was amazing.\n\nAs mentioned above, the shrimp and grits are fantastic.  I've had them at a few places that serve the dish in Atlanta and Los Angeles, but nothing can compare to the Crook's Corner original (at least in my mind it's the original).\n\nIf you can, sit outdoors.  Even in the winter, they've got heat lamps out, which don't get too hot, but keep you warm.\n\nAlso, in the men's room, there's a pig head in the wall, which is awesome.",

I mean... for the price, it's a pretty good deal.  If you're a meatophile like I am, you're likely to also love the #9 - it's chock full of salami, capicola, and ham.  And take their suggestion of adding hot peppers.  With plain oil and vinegar, it's adds a nice little kick to the sandwich.\n\nBright, clean, and airy... they either don't intend to do high traffic here, or people just grab-and-go, because seating's pretty limited.  Definitely smaller than the Evanston shop I'm used to.  Still, the decor's just as smart-ass and saucy as I remember; it's just my style!",

It also came with coleslaw and a wedge of lemon. \n\nSurprisingly the fish and chips weren't that oily so I didn't feel light headed after finishing it. The fish was decent and fries were addictive. I was sort of hoping the fish batter to be more crispy though as it was missing the crunch I usually look for in a good beer batter.  But overall I was satisfied and I can see myself coming back.\n\nAnother thing I should mention is the decor of this place. The whole place feels like an urban loft and has a warm, chill atmosphere.

Other Chinese restaurants around Berkeley are either disgusting take-out places or white washed wannabe pan-Asian joints. At TC you can get full off only $4 worth of food, $5 tops. Plus, you get free soup and hot tea. \n\nThe service is a typical Chinese restaurant style service, but slightly better. The main guy at the register is extremely considerate and laid back. There have been several times where I forgot to bring cash, and he just told me to pay him next time I came. Where else in Berkeley can you do that?\n\nThe food itself is really not greasy at all, unless you order something deep fried, in which case what do you expect. I would recommend the Chicken Chow Fun, String Bean Chicken/Beef/Pork, Scrambled Egg Chicken, and the Potstickers.\n\nIn terms of the environment, it's pretty average. It's just like Asian Ghetto on Southside if not cleaner. If you don't mind eating at Asian Ghetto along with trashcans overflowing with to-go boxes, then you won't mind eating here.",

She was fantastic.  We arrived 10 minutes before closing and she told us it was okay to stay and enjoy our sandwiches until after closing because they would just be cleaning up anyway (major points there).  Then, she brings out an extra Iced Mocha for free because she said she accidentally made too much (extra bonus points there).  \n\nThe Egg Salad Sandwich is just as delicious here.  I am not a fan of mayonnaise and hate how much mayo goes into egg salads and potato salads, but I just cannot help eating this sandwich.  Get it with the rosemary currant bread.  \n\nThe Iced Mocha was not anything to write home about, but it was refreshing on a hot day.  I doubt I would order it again.",

Meaning: Tommy Doyle's started off with the unfair advantage of being my second choice.  \n\nWe were the first customers of the day. It was 11:05 am and they had just opened. Service was great - we had no competition. The coffee was surprisingly good. Probably because it was really fresh.\n\nThe Omelette's were good. I got one with spinach, feta, pepperocini, tomatoes and olives and my husband got ham & cheese. They were the fluffy kind which I prefer to a flat omelette. The home fries were also really good. Large chunks of potatoes with skin on and not greasy. Everything was super hot and fresh tasting, likely because we were the first people to order food that morning. \n\nI can only give it 3 stars though because this place is really a bar, not a breakfast place. It doesn't have a cozy breakfast place feel. And to top it all off, they don't serve toast with their breakfast meals, which kind of annoyed me. I like to make little sandwiches with my omelette and I wasn't able to. \n\nBut if you are starving and don't wait to wait in line for Friendly Toast this is an ok second choice.",

The curtains are reminiscent of a jacket  Christian Bale wore in a scene from \"American Psycho\" to chop up one of his pals. The sink only delivers triple-x hot water - a sign near the taps warns as much. \n\nWhile one is using the stall, one feels...prone. \n\nI love a dive bar and will totally frequent a place that has sub-par rest rooms (Emo's, I mean you). But these women's rooms are actually chilling, so scary they seem intentional. Even though Grindhouse was filmed on the street here, I may tell tourists and out-of-towners that scenes from \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" were filmed here - in the bathrooms, of course.",

The small steamed buns are fantastic and come with a great ginger sauce to accompany it. If you are ordering scallion pie or the peking ravioli it comes with a spicy sauce, ask for hot oil and mix some in generously then dip away! Thank me later. You may gain a few pounds here but you may also sweat it out haha. Mongolian beef is also top-notch and the dun-dun noodles are great although I always forget to order them myself..\n\nI order the same thing all the time so this review is pretty much based on only 5-6 items. If you are looking for more americanized chinese food or super-authentic dim sum this is not the spot. \n\nMary is usually here and when she has an apron on you know you're in for a treat! Very friendly staff and great eats on the cheap. Can't beat that!",

We had some stand-by's like Chicken Tikka Massala and Naan with Raita . The portion sizes are nice and they offered to bring more rice which was unique and welcomed. The food tasted good - but that's where the star got docked -- it was just not spicy enough for me. I like my food spicy and hot and this was slightly spicy and very mild. They had brought some sauces to us when we got the cracker/bread/chip basket thing (not sure what that was -- first time I've had it!) and the one with cilantro pureed was excellent mixed with the raita and added on top of my entree. The chicken used was quite good - none of that extra fat in it that some places leave in (cheap or lazy I'm not sure which but I hate biting into fat!)\n\nThe wait and bus staff was exceptionally attentive, kept everything going well (filled water, bused table, etc). Really outstanding service IMHO. \n\nFor a first try we liked it. My daughter gave it a 5 and I'd of said about a 3 so we compromised on 4 stars.

Yeah, the pineapple fried rice is good, the pad thai is satisfactory, but they really need to stop watering down the curry.  You can't cut corners on curry, fricking pour in that coconut milk and make heart clench in high cholesterol pleasure.\n\nThe service is probably the most sub-par.  Sometimes they just don't understand special orders like \"Please don't make this spicy\" or \"Hi I am severely allergic to _____, please do not include it in my dish so I can eat my meal without going into anaphylactic shock.\"\n\nRecent e.g.\n\nTrang (My friend): Not spicy. Ok?\nCashier: Ok! (Scribbles down EXTREMELY HOT on receipt)\nTrang: Wait wait wait! This not spicy right?\nCashier: Oh yes!\n(Order comes out completely speckled with chiles)\n\nTL;DR: Cheap Thai food for under $10, but you really get what you pay for, and arguably less.  Be prepared to bring your own Epi-pen or spend a few secondss picking out unwanted ingredients before eating.",

I'm a fan because they're ALWAYS soft and hot/fresh.  They deliver, pretty speedily for them being freshly baked, and they're so very Austin.  They can make you an ice cream sandwich with any cookies you want, which is neat.  Also, the people that work there are always super nice!\n\nIt's not five stars because I've noticed recently (in the last year or so) that the flavor of the cookies is not as great as I remembered... has the quality gone down, or have they always tasted this way?  The perfect texture and warm freshness kind of makes up for it, but each time I eat them, I find that I feel more strongly that the flavor isn't perfect.  A good batch of homemade is still better.  So, I can't give a perfect rating... but I'm definitely still a fan.\n\nTiff's, you will always have a special place in my heart. =)",

Usually I get a smile and a conversation ice-breaker.  It's been years since I've been here, but by all indications, little changes.  In Pittsburgh's Oakland neighborhood, the heart of the college district, \"The O\" represents all of the angst and energy, the culinary hedonism and \"WTF\" attitude of my undergraduate years (in Cleveland).  Hot dogs are their namesake, and they're alright; the burgers and steak sandwiches are okay.  What everybody remembers about \"The O\" must be seen to be believed.  An order of fries or onion rings is huge beyond anticipation.  I would suspect that a few orders of fries from \"The O\" would have carried Napoleon's troops across Russia in the middle of winter.  Quantity aside, they're good.  You won't find the crisp, double-fried french fries or duck fat and truffle froufrou here; this is a roll-up-the-sleeves blue collar place.  I doubt that it is the cleanest place I've ever eaten in, but this isn't a place for whining and complaining, calorie-counting or sustaining a healthy diet.

Also, for a cuban places where drinks should be thier forte, they just aren't great-they don't even mash the mint leaves in the Mojitos!!  The food that I had was pretty good...I ordered the tacos al pastor from the appetizer menu, which had big chunks of pork, pineapple, and carmelized onions.  For my entre i ordered Arepas, which were corn meal cakes covered in pico de gallo, and goat cheese, which were a little bland and flavorless, and usually if something has goat cheese in it i'm sold!\nI have been there twice and will definitly not return.

By far my absolute favorite is the hot veggie sandwich.  It is so warm on toasted bread.  It's the perfect way to eat your veggies! Other favorites include the foccacia bread, the caprese sandwich, dawn's vegan salad, and the tuscan white bean soup. My husband swears by their PB and Stuff sandwich. \n\nAs for the pastries and desserts:  I had the chocolate chip cookie... I am not sure where they get their chocolate chips (the milk ones) but it leaves a funny after taste that does make me want to order another.  I also had a sample of the chocolate PB brownie... also not that great.  The PB center crumbled instantly and separated from the brownie.\n\nOther positives about this place: free wi fi, and plenty of seating.  I've never once had bad service and the employees are very friendly.  The better than any other sandwich place. So suck it Panera!\n\nLove this place and would recommend you give it a try! I am positive you would not be disappointed.",

                    "text": "I really wanted to like this place... and perhaps someday I will be back, but it won't be for a very long time.  Not until they've worked out a lot of issues.\n\nI can appreciate that during a soft opening, which is when our party of 7 attended, there will be glitches and I was by no means expecting a flawless service; however, the brazenly casual attitude of some of the wait staff paired with a 2.5 hour dinner service (not by our choice) cannot be justified.\n\nCLIFF NOTES VERSION OF MY REVIEW:\n- Who brings a bottle of wine to a table already uncorked and places it on the table with wine glasses and walks away?  No approval tasting, no pouring done whatsoever.  That's a first! \n\n- Cambodian style doesn't mean bringing out dishes 1 by 1 and expecting a family style meal to take place when portions are clearly individual and it's just not possible to share a single order of 4 fresh springs among 7 people - it just doesn't work.\n\n- My soon to be sister in law is Cambodian - so please don't disrespect her by telling her that this is traditional Cambodian style of service.  Just be honest - tell us that service is slower than optimal as you are still adjusting to having a larger restaurant with new wait staff.\n\n\nFULL REVIEW: \n\nWhen our party of 7 arrived at 7pm on a Saturday evening, the restaurant was about half-full.  We were given 2 or 3 menus to start with as the restaurant was running short on menus.  That wasn't a problem as within a few minutes time, more menus freed up.  We placed our drinks order & food order and chatted away while enjoying the ambiance of the restaurant (which is quite clean, nicely lit and overall comfortable).\n\nThis is when things started to go downhill.  Drinks started arriving one-by-one spaced out quite unevenly and we had to remind our waitress that some of us were still missing drinks.  My brother's fianc\u00e9e and I ordered a bottle of Kenwood Merlot to share - the bottle was placed on the table, already uncorked, accompanied by two wine glasses.  Our wine was not opened in front of us, we were not poured a taste nor were we even poured our wine.  It was just all put down in front of us.  First time that's ever happened to me in a restaurant.  Never mind the fact that the wine was not very good - it seemed watered down in taste, very light-bodied.  Not what I'm used to in a Merlot.\n\nNext, 1 of our 2 appetizers of Fresh Spring Rolls arrived.  A single order has 4 pieces, mind you we are a party of 7 so we were expecting the second order to come out simultaneously (or at least within close proximity).  After waiting for 5-10 minutes, we questioned our waitress on the status of our second plate of rolls and were told that this restaurant provides Cambodian Family Style service - so plates are meant to be shared and food is brought out one at a time as it is ready.  Seriously?  We are supposed to share 4 rolls between 7 of us then get another 4 rolls to share again?  How does this logic make any sense?\n\nEven the soups we ordered for appetizers came out at a staggered pace.  My friend finished his before mine was even brought to the table.  That said, the Shrimp Tom Yum soup and Chicken Lemon Soup were both quite tasty and well executed.\n\nFinally, our entr\u00e9es - there was a good 30 minutes time difference between the arrival of our first and last entr\u00e9e.  We also had to remind our waitress for the rice bowls that were supposed to accompany our dishes.  Given the size of the plates and the individual portions of rice doled out, I do not consider these really family style and my brother's fianc\u00e9e, who is Cambodian, agreed.  Again, the food itself was delicious - we ordered Loc Lac, Cha Ugg (which resembled a plate of Alpo dog food but tasted much better than it looked thankfully), Cha Krung (tasty) and Chicken Fried Rice (for those less adventurous in our party).\n\nAlthough we wanted dessert, 2.5 hours had lapsed since we were first seated and the thought of waiting another hour for our dessert did not sit well with us.  I will commend the staff for allowing myself, my brother and his fianc\u00e9e the opportunity to visit the kitchen and speak to the Chef.  As my soon to be sister-in-law mentioned to the Chef, the food is good and we understand that things are busy, but the suboptimal service is what we found inexcusable.\n\nI'd like to give Floating Rock another shot... after my trauma has subsided and after they've worked out their kinks.",

It was so hard to find a Pub to compare with so many I enjoyed abroad (dark wood, large TV's to watch the game, and chips served hot to help you get through the afternoon drinking pints of your favorite beer).  Finally getting to Dublin, the one variation I noticed was an almost unending stream of live entertainment, a man, his instrument, and a crowd eager to sing along.\n\nFat Belly's Providence opened in early December, and has fast become my favorite Pub in Providence.  Combining all of the things I hope for in a Public House, Fat Belly's has something like 17 beers on tap (with one of the coolest Tap systems I have seen on this side of the pond), a huge selection of Scotch, TVs everywhere, and menu filled with all of the things I love to eat while I'm drinking. But what really makes this THE spot is the live music up stairs Thursday Friday and Saturday nights.  \n\nI can't tell you how much I felt like I was back in Dublin.  D\u00e9cor, good food and drink, and live music, all help make this feel like a real Pub, a public house, somewhere you feel at home.  I'll definitely be drinking here for years to come.",

I was visiting the UCLA campus to check it out, it was a hot day. Naturally, I began to crave some cold and delicious boba! I figured it would taste even better since it is closer to Asia. :D\nAnyway, I stumbled upon this place when searching for the first bubble tea place in site. I bought a taro/coconut smoothie, which is usually a delicious combination. They were out of rainbow jellies so I ordered lychee jellies since tapioca is apparently bad for you. The bubble tea ended up costing 4.50 for a small taro/coconut with jelly, pretty expensive as far as bubble tea goes. It was way too sweet, tasted powdery, and they put wayyy too much jelly in it, and it was so sweet I was spitting it out my entire walk home.\nGross! It was the second time I have ever regretted wasting my money.\nI didn't try any other food so I am in no position to judge any other factors of the restaurant, but I definitely do not recommend its bubble tea.",

I got my drink and waited for my hotdog... I waited about 10 minutes to get my order.  Sat down and took a bite of the hotdog... to be honest, I wasn't impressed with the hotdog... but man, that jalapeno pepper was HOT... my mouth was burning.... overall, the hotdog wasn't anything special... \n\nSecond Visit - I went with double with ketchup, mustard, A-1 Sauce... left the vegetables out... took bite out of the burger... minus being messy, I wasn't impressed with the burger as well... not sure if because I didn't get lettuce and tomato with the order, but the meat was blend...   I did try the fries this time and I actually liked the fries... \n\nI like how they offer peanuts for free and allow you to add any of the toppings from their offering.  If there's no table on the main floor, head to the basement for more seating... but be warned, if you are taller then 6ft4in, watch your head...\n\nOverall, I'm still In & Out fan... but I like Five Guys fries better.  Parking can be challenging... the place can get busy, so give yourself some extra time.",

While we understand the pains when hiring inexperienced help, this one rates way up there! The hostess gave us Friday's specials list, the waitress was more interested in chatting with the rest of the staff that making sure her customers were served. I ordered a cup of Chili as an appetizer and Shepherds Pie as the main course. As time went by it became apparent that she was planning to serve them together. When we asked her to bring the Chili first she went to the kitchen, quickly returning to say that another server had taken her Chili order. A bit later the replacement order came out, not even warm enough to melt the cheese on top! Of course, the Shepherds Pie came out minutes later. Another member of the party had also ordered the Shepherds Pie. The mashed potatoes were barely warm and the meat & vegetables was only slightly warmer. I'm pretty sure they sat, waiting for her to stop chatting to collect the food for her customers. \n\nI will say that both the Chili & Shepherds Pie were very tasty. I'd bet they would have been much better if served hot! \n\nNot sure if I'd go back.",

Our large-ish group ordered 3 different broths, all of which looked suspiciously the same -- like cloudy dishwater.  The overwhelming flavor of each was salt.  I think they dissolved some bouillon cubes in some hot water and served them as miso, regular, and a third variety that I'm blanking on at the moment (perhaps because the memorable flavor was ... salt!).\n\nThat ought to be enough to put you off this place.  But in case you still think Shabu Square might have some redeeming qualities that could merit checking it out in person, please allow me to further disabuse you of that sadly mistaken idea.  Their spring rolls were hard and tasteless (again, all I remember is saltiness).  Their lighting is harsh, they don't serve alcohol, and their waitstaff, while friendly, has such a poor grasp of English that ordering will be a tortured process of repetitions, menu pointing, and wondering if you'll get what you actually tried to order.\n\nIn short:  Do Not Go!

We were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad, which was bland (I make a better version at home), chicken salad, nothing special either, and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite.  Unfortunately, it was the size of a quarter, it was literally a bite.  But it was the best part of the meal!!!  (I don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread).\n\nWe were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog.   Neither was anything special, eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever!\n\nThen, the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte, again, fine.  And a chocolate mousse/brownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white, mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.  \n\nOh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World), cinnamon spice!!!  Unfortunately, when I asked for more tea, they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag! \n\nI've gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison.  Not impressed at all!

I needed to get out of the house and I need to do something that didn't involve alcohol for fear that something would happen with him and I would be trashed. So when it doubt, food is the answer. My besties came with me and we decided to eat a small feast of food from the SD. We started off with Chili and Southwestern Egg Rolls.. They were both very good and we ate them all up even before the waiter had time to ask how they were.. We had burgers and fries and onion rings and everything was hot and juicy. The waiter was very nice and polite and he was very good.  We were so full, we thought we would need a wheel barrow to take us out but we didn't. We did get cake to go. (Yes I know!)

If you are not a regular, it's kinda hard to figure out the ordering paper thing. My mom and I are not regulars, and it seemed like we ordered everything under the sun on our first round (I'm sure this didn't make the chef's very happy) but the server was helpful and they didn't make us feel weird (as other places have.) The only downfall to this place is that, no matter the weather outside, it is hot inside! Do not wear a sweater or sweatshirt, and try to sit next to the one big oscillating fan. It would be a lot cooler if they utilized their outdoor patio.\n\nThe food is really good, good quality (keep in mind I am not a connoisseur) with a really good price for AYCE (don't recommend if you don't have a big appetite.)",

They have hamburgers, cheeseburgers, and bacon cheeseburgers. I ordered the little hamburger and you can add any condiments you like with your burger. The little burgers come with 1 patty and the regular burgers come with 2 patties. The cashier did not explain clearly what the difference was between a little and a regular burger. I had to figure it out myself.  \n\nI ordered my burger with lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, jalopenos, and hot sauce. I also ordered the Cajun fries with my meal. The bun was too thin and soggy. And the burger tasted kind of bland. It got really disgusting when I was half way through my burger and the buns became all mushy. The fries were also greasy and heavy. The Cajun flavor was kind of flat and did not have the zing I was looking for. \n\nI wished that I had stopped by In n Out instead. Bleck.",

The atmosphere is homely and comfortable but not so much you feel like your having a regular joe night out.  Its as unpretentious as homely can get I guess is the best way to put it.  The nights are solid and great but the brunch is not one to miss.  My friends and I were loyal every sunday for many months.  The buffet is top notch.  A great mix of breakfast and lunch that can be so hard for some \"claimed\" brunch establishments but here it all flowed with little effort it would seem.  over all the food is great if not superb.  The scene is hot and the people are too.  Its a great way to start the evening or cure a hangover sunday morning.  Check it out and get the brunch, if it peaks your interest come back for dinner.  Im sure it will please",

I have had to give up going here after multiple instances of wait staff that forget about you and your food order that sits on the counter getting cold before it makes it to your table. We have had been served pizzas where the dough in the middle is raw (no, not soggy, raw). \n\nThe final blow was one day when it was just too hot to cook, and for some reason we were compelled to give it a last chance. We were seated, placed our order and got our drinks. Once we had settled in I noticed that it was quite warm in there. It ends up that their AC was broken, but I guess they couldn't be bothered to tell us when we came in. \n\nI can only guess that whoever runs this location just doesn't give a damn and that their attitude is reflected in the people who  stay around to work there.",

It was cold creamy goodness, and incredibly flavorful. Next time I was around the village I couldn't resist temptation to treat myself to another. My mistake was waiting five minutes til i got home, to enjoy it. AND BLASPHEMY! It was horrendous, there was too much ice in it, and that just took away from it.. Ugh, it was like drinking crushed ice and watered down milk with sugar. (yeah it was that bad) But yet i decided to give it another shot after a hot day and strong craving for cold goodness. When i walked in the same guy was there (didn't want him to screw it up again) so i got the plain frozen yogurt. Couldn't go wrong with it. Still I have to stay the place is overpriced over it's head. Pretty much what you're paying for is to sit around in their pseudo mini art gallery.\nI think i'd rather get ice cream from a grocery store, or better yet this place may have inspired me to get an ice cream maker...Preeeetty soon, i hope.",

Also, I noticed if I am at a concert or yoga class (rooms that are hot and sweaty) a sweet scent emits from my hair the day I use the shampoo bar. I've received compliments from strangers. I have found the shampoo bars to be a worthwhile little splurge. I use it occasionally but always have one on hand in a little tin that I also purchased - this keeps it from disentigrating in the shower.\n\nI've tried some bath bombs - just ok. I wasn't impressed by the strength of the scents and find all of the gimicky stuff they put in them to be a nuisance - glitter, bark, whatever. Being disappointed by the bath bombs did inspire me to buy bulk sea salt elswhere and create my own baths with that as well as essential oils.\n\nI want to try their soaps. Always avoided them becuase I remember they are not cheap. I recently found a similar shop on the west coast I adore: Lather and Fizz - google it and order their soap - you won't regret it!",

He had a craving for IB's today so we drove up and ate together there for the first time! We both got giant buckets of the chili cheese fries with jalapenos. MMMM. Nothing better than greasy comfort food! I love how hot the fries are, how gooey they get with the rich chili and nacho cheese sauce, and how the jalapenos add a little kick to the whole thing. When I was a student I used to eat these fries along with the hoagies (can we say delicious artery clogging goodness wrapped in buns??).\n\nThe food here is great for whiling away time between classes, a late afternoon snack/lunch, and just when you have an uber junk food craving. The sad thing, is that the prices have gone up a lot since I was a student. There also isn't very much seating, so it's always a grab and go place.",

(You may have heard of him, he's Yelp Elite, nbd). Well not being MCB majors, we were bound to get beat down. BUT.... (long story short) (for the long and boring story you can read his review) we noticed that eating an Urbann Turbann bowl or wrap before each midterm would result in a statistically significant domination of that midterm. So having both done poorly on the first one, we proceeded to gorge there before the midterms and final, and consequently got A's in the class. We're hoping to publish these results of finding positive correlation between the number of Urbann Turbann bowls/wraps you eat the day of the test to the number of standard deviations above the mean you will get on that test. Look for it in the next issue of Nature.\n\nOnto the less important stuff, the service is super friendly and fast. You get a heap ton of food too and it's all really good. You can add as many chutneys as you want for a full rainbow of flavors and I like putting on the Hot Mint and Cilantro and the Fiery Tomato/Habanero/Cumin. I think what I especially like about this place is the fact that everything comes in even dollar amounts. \n\nIn conclusion come here if you are at all hesitant.",

Think of it as Indian food that can come wrapped up in the most delicious wrap you've ever had.\n\nThis isn't one of those nonsense \"wraps\" that they serve at Subway that is a sandwich in a tortilla. A major injustice to the tortilla, I might add. Nay, this is an amazing, freshly made, slightly chewy bread that has a layer of garbanzo bean mush (aka chick pea, or chana) on the inside. With each bite, every taste bud in your mouth shivers with glee.\n\nI've only ever had the Aloo and Chana (Potato and Garbanzo bean) Roti and by the time I'm done my legs have turned to mush and my brain has shut down in ecstasy. Don't forget to add some of their special house made HOT sauce. If one were to cannibalize Jesus, he'd probably taste something like this. I hear that the meat stuff is even better, so just go eat it. You won't regret it.\n\nTo top it off, the staff there is way friendly and the setting is casual and welcoming.",

We ordered 4 different styles of 6 bone-in wings each:a dry rub which I wasn't crazy about, the Hot Wings which were definitely spicy and making my eyes water, the Mango Habenero wings which were supposedly spicier on the scale but I thought was sweet, and the Spicy Garlic, which was an all around crowd pleaser. Onion rings were tasty but I was just too full by the time they came to the table. Best thing about being in this college town is that they have great beer specials ($2 until 9pm!), the waitress lets you know when the specials are about to end and they automatically give you separate checks because they are used to the kids using their dining cards.",

Now Gus and sister Mimi run the place. Tosci's has THE best ice cream selection in Cambridge. Quality is outstanding, too -- on par with (if not slightly better than) Christina's and Lizzy's, if you're comparing it to local non-chain establishments. But Tosci's always has incredible, creative variety.\n\nNot only does Tosci's have ample seating, but the seats (very heavy metal chairs and couches) were actually made by former Tosci's employee and local craftsman Adam Simha!\n\nSo why on earth am I giving Tosci's only 4 stars and not 5? Because it's really, really expensive. For the portion size (pretty small), Tosci's is the most expensive ice cream around, by far. It's a shame, because I'd go there far more often, like I used to, if they were still more reasonably priced. But hey, it's a treat, and you get what you pay for!

They offer 25 flavors, but it boils down to the standard buffalo flavor, BBQ, teriyaki, and about 5 unique ones all in different levels of spiciness. With that said, my favorite flavors have to be Hot Honey BBQ and Nuclear Honey Teriyaki. I was a bit disappointed in the Lemon Pepper because it was extremely oily and had virtually no Lemon Pepper taste. I've gotten it multiple times to be sure I didn't get a bad batch but to no avail.\n\nThe buffalo shrimp is a nice addition to a wing restaurant. Not to mention, the prices are reasonable with the coupons that they email out if you create an online account. Finally, the place is never busy so the wait for takeout is on average about 10-15 minutes.\n\nHowever, it has a few shortcomings. First off, don't expect to dine in here as the dining area is 2 indoor booths and 2 outdoor benches. And while the wings are fantastic, the number and quality of side choices needs to be improved.  The wedge fries and mozzarella sticks are very average.  \n\nThe wings are excellent, but if you want to watch the big game, I would head to Pluckers for the superior atmosphere and better overall wing eating experience.",

                    "text": "On my mission to sample to delicacies of Troy, NY, I stopped by \"The Placid Baker\" today after noticing this bakery on a weekend stroll.\n\n\"The Placid Baker\" is an artisan bakery nestled in downtown Troy near Tosca and the now (apparently) defunct Illium cafe. According to their little menu, this bakery tries to use as much organic and local produce as possible.\n\nUpon entering the bakery, I noticed that the decor was simple, but gave of a great air of being natural and homey; the open air and natural lighting added to this ambiance. There isn't too much seating, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem given the nature of the area. The woman behind the counter was somewhat shy, but she was helpful and nice.\n\nThe pastries in the display cases look fresh and tasty - I wouldn't mind coming here again to sample a few of them. The prices are fair, running between $1.50 to $3 per pastry. The sandwich and bread selection available were written in chalk on the wall you face once you enter the bakery. The only thing I would improve regarding this display menu was writing down what beverages the bakery had available, as well as their respective prices. I thought they had a modest selection on their menu which compared well with their size and client\u00e8le.\n\nI ordered a Cubano sandwich ($5.50): Niman Ranch roasted pork, Black Forest Ham, swiss cheese, pickles, and whole grain mustard on a Ciabatta Roll. I had it heated on the panini grill, halved, and wrapped to go. When I got to my room, the sandwich was cool, but that's no surprise, I took a side-trip to a few other places.\n\nThe sandwich was very nicely wrapped in heavy brown paper. The sandwich was a medium sized portion, and half of it was more than enough to fill me up. I'm not particularly fond of pickles, so I took those out. They definitely didn't skimp on pickles though, the sandwich was artfully layered - they took two thin lengthwise slices of a pickle, halved them horizontally, and put them as one layer on the sandwich. \n\nOn the first bite of the sandwich, my first thought was, \"the Ciabatta is perfectly crusty on the outside, and soft on the inside.\" Next, \"GOD THIS SANDWICH IS SO GOOD.\" I like sandwiches, but I don't -love- them. I love this Cubano, even at a cool temperature, when I usually like my sandwiches hot. I could distinctively taste the ham and the pulled pork (the pork especially), and the nice tang of the mustard.\n\nI also had a cup of tea (16 fl. oz, $2.00, although their menu states $1.75) with my sandwich. They feature Divinitea Premium Organic & Biodynamic teas, and they had three available today - Ceylon Green Tea, Irish Breakfast, and some other I can't recall. I had the Irish Breakfast, and was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was looseleaf tea that was steeped using a small satchel held in place on the edge of the cup. The temperature of the water was -perfect-, piping hot (black tea is supposed to be steeped with boiling water anyways).\n\nThe bakery had Sugar in the Raw, PureVia, and Blue Agave sweetener available. I wanted to try the Blue Agave, but they were out, so I went with the PureVia. I usually have my tea with some half-and-half, but I didn't see any milk selections so I just had my tea with sugar. Surprisingly, this tea is perfectly fine without any milk to smooth it out. It went over the palate well and didn't leave any rough, drying feeling behind.\n\nAs I left the bakery, the only thing that scared me was the clash of the wooden screen door closing.\n\nBar that, I'm definitely returning to \"The Placid Baker.\"",

We didn't think it would be busy because of ACL because we thought everyone would be down at Zilker.  You'd think that people paying upwards of $200 for tickets to a show would stay there, wouldn't you?  Apparently not.\n\nWe waited 20 minutes in line before getting to the counter.  We waited ages for our food.  When the food finally arrived, there were two sad pieces of eggplant in my sister's eggplant sub (served in a pita-type pocket rather than a sub), and for the first time in 16 years, our large Sicilian cheese pie was cut not into 16, or even 20, but 24 slices.  This is not a pie that can be cut into 24 slices.  Most of the pieces were about 2\" by 4\".  They were like pizza fingers instead of slices.\n\nThe lines were so long, and the place so understaffed that we couldn't get refills for drinks, or order another beer the whole time we were eating.\n\nNormally this place is a 4 or a 5, but when you're looking at ACL or SXSW weekend, this place drops to a 2-star, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  Not that it's better elsewhere, but I've experienced better here at Milto's many times.  Just be aware that Milto's hasn't been the hole in the wall it used to be in nearly 10 years - it's now overrun with students and hipsters.\n\nP.S.

They have that loyalty stamp card where you buy 5 Boba and you'll get a free one. It kept me coming back... I was quite hooked.\n\nBut when other hip trendy desert ish places popped up, bubble island couldnt keep up in their offering. Other spots like stucchi's also serves bubble tea at a cheaper price. Yogobliss across the street posed serious threat to their market.\n\nBut overall, the Bubble Island still offers a wide array of hangout food and board games for as little as 2 people - to a large party of 15. Seating is kinda tight, but you can always make it work.\n \nFroyo. Super fail. bleh. Don't ever get it here. It's 10X better across the street and anywhere else on campus.\n\nBBT. Decent. I always get taro and I've tried a wide assortment of honeydew and other fruit flavors. It's very consistent and good for its price. I've had more specialized and flavorful BBT elsewhere, but we're talking Michigan here, so I'm pretty gracious here.\n\nMochi Ice Cream. Pretty good IMO. Frozen really well. Don't touch with your teeth or it will hurt. Good assortment of flavors and pretty hard to find mochi elsewhere on campus. Good diamond in the rough.\n\nPopcorn Chicken and Curly fries. Good bang for buck. Popcorn chicken comes out really hot and crispy and so do the fries too. Also have good honey mustard and ranch sauces to complement. Has been an all time favorite of mine.",

I am SO excited to find a cool place close to the University with vegan options!\n\nWe went here on a Saturday night. It was VERY dark in the restaurant, which was a little odd since I could barely see my food. The waitress was prompt and polite but not overly friendly- whatever; I'd probably be pissed if I had to deal with customers all day, too. Anyway, we ordered the Pickadippa appetizer (chips + 3 sauces of your choice). It came out right away and was extremely yummy. I highly recommend the avocado-tomatillo salsa. \nI ordered the Angry Hippie burrito with soy cheese and tofu sour cream. It was HUGE (at least twice the size of what I was expecting) and very, very yummy. Low on the salt, so I dosed it liberally with one of the hot sauces that sits on the table. The side salad that comes with it was very small, but who needs a side when you're wrangling a burrito the size of your head?! \nThe kitchen forgot my soy cheese, but when I flagged down our waitress she ran to get me some straightaway. No big deal. \n\nMy husband got some veggie thing with tofu- I honestly can't remember what- but he really liked it. \n\nSodas are $2.25 each, which is honestly BS. I mean, really? You can get a liter of soda for less than that. \n\nThe bathrooms were clean and covered with Edward Munsch-esque art. Freaky but cool. \n\nAll in all I would highly recommend this place. It's not authentic Mexican by any standards, but I really don't think it claims to be. The atmosphere was nice and not crowded on a Saturday night, which was nice since I really don't like crowded restaurants.",

The place itself is pretty run-down and uninviting, but we were starving.  We go in and grab 2 of the remaining 4 plates and view the buffet - had we not been starving and just gone through the pain of finding somewhere to park in Ann Arbor, we would simply have left. There was very little that even looked appetizing.  There were several empty containers showing ugly looking remnants of what had been there earlier (I will post pics if I can) and VERY little with any meat in it.  There was some nasty looking small fried fish that smelt fit for the dumpster, there was some \"chilly chicken\" that despite the name was hot but was actually deep fried in batter (like in a very bad chinese) so that what you got was \"chilly batter\" where some chicken might be found in about 10% of those nasty little suckers.  Then there was some goat curry.  Now sorry goat is not for me.  The naan bread had been sitting on heat trays so long it was dry and crunchy.  There was a guy kept waiting for 5 minutes just to get a plate.  NASTY NASTY place.\n\nI went to pay and the manager asked me how it was, I told him I would never return plus much of the above and I also asked where was the boneless lamb they proudly announce on the yelp page.  He replied that it was the weekend, and they don't serve lamb on weekends - below then I have posted the quote from the yelp page \"boneless lamb everyday\"  - I think \"bulls@#t everyday\" is more accurate.  AVOID at all costs and never never go there hungry. Why can't I give 0 stars??\n\n\"We don't cut corners..Boneless Lamb everyday in the Buffet...Vegan or Vegetarian..No Problem.. Come in \"",

They add to the mood by playing news from different countries and Korean dramas on tvs even though sometimes weird children puppet shows have appeared. \n\nFood: Being Asian, I was pleasantly surprised that the food was pretty good! I was expecting fake panda express but I guess rendezvous already covers that. They have different themes everyday: Vietnamese and Indian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Thai.  The first time I came here they were serving tuna sashimi seaweed flatbread. Yes tuna. SASHIMI. It was delicious! (now rarely served) If you are lucky, they have short rib! Their ramen was pretty good too, and lemongrass coconut milk soup mmm. Some other favorites include: duck soup, spicy shrimp sushi, and samosas.\nTheir daily staples seem to include some type of curry, fries, sandwich, and a rice/ noodle option. They also have that delicious sesame salad dressing from the chicken wonton salad at bcafe as well as an array of side dishes such a kimchi, bean sprouts, radish, pickles etc. The downside is that portions are small; I usually have to get 2-3 servings of one dish which is pretty annoying.\n\nDesserts:  outstanding as well - mango coconut sticky rice, custard buns, red bean mochi, tapioca, green tea ice cream just to name a few! Also a good hot tea selection - try the organic oolong and rose tea!\n\nDrinks: the passion juice is delicious but their specialty drinks are hit and miss - do NOT get the alien green pandan or tamarind. The Thai tea and Vietnamese coffee are pretty good but rarely served from what I've experienced. They also have barley tea, ginger, and chai tea sometimes. \n\nSadly only open for lunch: 11-2, but I have been coming here every chance I get!",

One fine day, we got lost and my shopaholic friends' keen eyes happen to glance by and saw this place so we finally checked it out. \n\nWhen you walk in, there's a sense of bling bling in the air. Smells tastefully expensive with all the rhinestones and swarovskis just blinging on their premium denims and T's. They obviously need a much bigger place to be able to display everything on their website, but since it just open, i'm sure they're just testing the water to see what us Atlantans find enticing. \n\nTo start off, they did not have a sales rack, so for one, they're very new and two, since they only carry the latest trends and obviously not everyone in atlanta walks around in their clothing line yet, they can afford not to put anything on the sales rack. You an be the first to flaunt it! :O)\n\nThey carry the latest True Religions, Rock and Republic, Monarchy Collection, Salvage (there's alot of Salvage on their website that is on sale!!), Juicy Couture, Toki Doki, Kimikal, Rawtage and brands I've never even heard of yet, but are hella hot.  They have a lot of haute belts and accessories as well. I do have to say, to keep up with the trends, you have to constantly keep up with your wallet as well. Make sure they're plenty stashed because their prices stings like a bee. \n\nHowever, a tip for all those fashionista, if you go to their website (www.emoda.com) you can order most of everything that they have in this store (tax and shipping free) all year long. \n\nLove the store, people were nice. we didn't get anything but it was nice to finally be able to touch some of the things and then let it go.",

Then suddenly the door just slammed shut!! We were super freaked! It was like someone (a ghost) pulled the door and slammed it shut. There's absolutely no way the door couldve done that!! I also woke up several times drenched in sweat and hot as hell, and our room was freezing and kept at 60 degrees! Conclusion is, doubletree Austin definetley has some paranormal activity going on!",

It is situated in an old house in a residential area that you just might miss if you weren't paying attention. \n\nLa Fondita is total mex-mex, no tex-mex going on here. I went out with two other people and we ordered way more food than we should have to get a really good sample of what they had to offer. We started with chicken flautas, which were crisp and covered with lettuce, tomato, crema, and queso fresco. The toppings were good and the flauta exterior crispy, but the chicken was pretty flavorless so we added a lot of salsa.\n\nNext, we had chorizo tacos which were excellent. The chorizo was perfect, spicy and crisp nestled in a fresh corn tortilla. Moving on to enchiladas verde which were kind of mediocre and suffered from similar problems as the flautas and remedied again with copious amounts of salsa verde.\n\nBeef torta was a little dry and would benefit from some beans or mayonesa/crema. Quesadillas - Chicken tinga was very good, mushroom and corn was meh. Bisteca a la mexican was excellent. Strips of chewy flavorful beef simmered in what was like a hot chunky pico de gallo. Beans and rice were throw away sides. Finally, horchata was also meh.\n\nYou are probably wondering how much all of this cost? $40 for flautas, 2 tacos, 2 quesadillas, 1 torta, 1 enchilada plate, 1 beef entree, and 2 horchatas. Oh, and they take credit cards!\n\nBottom line: prices are great, dishes hit or miss.",

I actually wanted to give less stars for this review, but I just can't do it because so many memories are tied up in this place (pun intended!)\n\nAfter ManRay closed, I was wondering what might happen to Hubba and my assumptions have proved correct. Instead of remaining a  S&M and Goth haven, Hubba has now become more of a sex toy store. Sure, you can go in and find all kinds of books, dildos, and cheap, plastic handcuffs, but what happened to the real flava?!\n\nBack when I was new to Boston and making no money at a crappy temp job, I used to squeal with delight at all of the hot Gothy numbers that used to grace the racks. Things there have always been expensive, but at least my rent was only $250 a month, so an occasional splurge was something I could actually do. I still have all of my stuff too, like two Versatile Corsets corsets, a couple of Catherine Coatney mesh skirts, and a PolyMorphe latex evening gown. The only issue now is that I have no where to wear these things anymore, so they just sit in a plastic Rubber Maid bin, waiting for the second coming.\n\nHubba also had a very decent selection of S&M gear: harnesses, whips, paddles, and all kinds of things to keep your local Dom happy. At some of the area's fetish nights, there would even be an occasional 'fashion show' (with yours truly as a model) where you could see these things live and on stage. Now that's kinky!\n\nIts funny because over the years, there have been a ton of rumors regarding the re-opening of ManRay. One interesting one was that ManRay was actually going to open at the current site of Hubba Hubba. I don't know how they'd pull that off (or even if they are actually still considering it) but damn, wouldn't that be fitting.",

The restaurant is huge...and has darkwood floors (my favorite) and candles and little vases with flowers everywhere.  You really feel like you are in a five star restaurant.  I was floored when I saw the prices on the menu....it was very very very reasonable.  \n\nI went to Amore with a friend for dinner and started out with a glass of wine, which was really nice and smooth.  The bread (pita bread) that they bring out in the beginning had a nice flavor, but it was dry.  Seemed like the bread was brick ovenbaked, but it didn't have butter or any sides to go with it.  \n\nCalamari was kind of fishy and overly fried, the beef kabobs were tasty, but chewy and the main dish.....\"spicy pastrami pizza\"....which was more like a pepperoni pizza.  The pizza did taste good, which was brick ovenbaked....and very gooey.  While I do love brick ovenbaked pizza, because the taste is like no other, a little variety would have been nice to see on the menu.  \n\nBUT, the best part of dinner was the dessert...cappucino truffle ice cream and the gelato coco ice cream truffle...with a nice cup of hot cappucino.....hit the spot.  My friend and I could not get enough of the truffles.....oh so good.....\n\nOverall the restaurant is beautiful inside and also very big.....even big enough for a wedding reception :) they have upstairs seatings as well....and by the looks of the restaurant and the fact that it is a mediterranean restaurant....they have got to have belly dancers on Saturdays (still researching that)....and if not, they should definitely look into getting some dancers.",

While the periodic table of their menu is a creative thought, I would really rather that you provide me with a menu that I can hold. Some people can't see the whole menu at certain angles. Lucky for you, I already came in here knowing I was planning on having the ronie (get it? - Roni E!) burger anyway, thanks to Tom E. \n\nHoly Hell this is HOT!!! Mind you I am one to normally be able to handle my spice, but this burger was made with jalapenos topped with pepper jack cheese, served with homefries and a pickle. Although I enjoyed the burger, I had to stop every so often to cool off my palate. The homefries are sauteed with onions and a salsa type sauce which was definitely different for me but consumed with content none the less. \n\nSo the verdict - the food was great. \nThe service --- not so much. \n\nMy biggest issue I guess with this place is that it's a free for all when trying to grab a table. There's no order or a host that can control seating. So people kind of just hover over tables waiting to see who will finish next and then dash for tables as soon as someone puts on their jacket. \n\nSo to the owners of Miracle of Science - I fully expect the next time I come in that you've made the following improvements: \n1. Hire a Host. \n2. Print out menus for customers who want to be able to hold something in their hands to read rather than trying to squint to read the board.",

                    "text": "I first tried froyo a few years ago in Cali. It was weird. When I moved to New York, the froyo craze was hitting the East Coast. Now, I firmly believe if you're going to eat something as a treat, there's no half-assing it. No popsicles for me. Haagen-Dazs and Ben & Jerry's baby.  So, I thought foyo was just for all those skinny chicks to talk about how much they looooove indulging in froyo, to show how they can let loose with food, too. Bitch, please. When I'm trying out a new ice cream brand, I look at the calorie content when trying a new flavor--the more calories the better. Trying Pinkberry, which is ubiquitous out East, solidified that opinion. The original flavor was too sour and tart. \n\nThen I tried Red Mango. It's my favorite of the big chains. The texture of the froyo is creamy, the original is sweet and not sour, and the green tea is amaaaaazing. I was saddened to see that there was no green tea at this location (green tea + mochi was my thing). There's the original, Madagascar vanilla (slightly sour vanilla bean), Tangomonium (sorta tropical Starburst-y), pomegranate (er, tangy pomegranate), a seasonal flavor (white peach--like an Asian-flavored candy), and, apparently, another seasonal flavor (key lime pie).\n\nThe people up front are super sweet and you can get samples. The toppings are standard--mochi, chocolates, cereals, etc. There's also smoothies: fruit-based, protein, or tea-infused, all with boost options. Now you can get a meal (smoothie) and dessert in one go, like me. Make sure you don't take it back to a really cold office, or you'll have to run out to Starbucks to get yourself a hot cocoa. Now, if you'll excuse me....",

It's close to our house, so we went there fairly regularly for a while.\n\nThis year (2009) we've tried going to Tamarind a couple of times and have been grossly disappointed. \n\nThe service is deplorable.  One time, our server kept delivering our food with such disregard that our soup spilled all over the table, and each dish she brought was clunked onto the table so hard that I began wondering if she was testing the strength of the plates.\n\nShe did not listen to our order and neglected to bring our appetizer at all.\nAnother time, we had a male server who was very inattentive. As we tried to get his attention to request a hot sauce condiment, it became clear that he had iPod earphones in his ears and was not interested in checking on the progress of our meal.\n\nThe last two times, we've just ordered take-out.  The first time, the meal was OK, but the portions are smaller than when you eat in. \n\nThe last time we bothered to order food from there it was because my son was in the mood for Thai food and it is within walking distance.  He was disgusted by the quality and tiny portion and found it to be so greasy that it was inedible.\n\nDespite it's convenient location, we will never go back to Tamarind.  Since they opened, the quality of the food has taken a dive and they have hired incompetent and apathetic staff.\nToo bad.",

You can do a take-out buffet, which is a great deal because you can carry much more in the container they give you than you could ever eat in one sitting. Sometimes it's even been three meals for me!\n- The food is good (lots of veggie options + salad), but the service is really quite poor. And there's not much service involved in the buffet. They bring the naan to your table, and we were almost done eating with no naan in sight. So we asked the waiter, and he gave a snippy response, but it did come eventually. They used to ask if you wanted plain or garlic, but they didn't this time (see cost-cutting measures below).\n\nMy new number one complaint, though, is that they don't have pompadum anymore! Nooooooooooo!! I suppose it's to save money (though surely pompadum is cheaper than another dish? There wasn't an empty spot on the buffet line), but this was really Cafe of India's saving grace for me, because I am a pompadum fiend. I think now the only place in HSq that provides pompadum with the buffet is Tamarind Bay, though I haven't been there in a while to confirm.\n\nIn short, there is no compelling reason for me to go there anymore, aside from the fact that it's the closest decent place where I can get hot food from my office.",

It's also my way of gauging whether or not a so-called sub place is worth my money.  Recently, Harvard Square's new Italian place, Lamole, delivered an overly cheesy, nothing-special version to my office desk.\n\nToday I ventured to Al's in the Holyoke Center based on the recommendation of office-mate Betty who cited value as the main reason she keeps going back.  At 12:15, the hot sub line was hopping.  My order was taken quickly and called shortly after, so I only briefly noticed the assembly line that is the kitchen--grills were full, subs were stuffed, then plunked into a holder near the cash register where they are bagged up.\n\nAccording to the menu, what I actually ordered was the Steak Bellino ($5.50 for a small), which is \"Seasoned steak with grilled peppers and onions.\"  Deciding to stray from American cheese, I went with provolone.  My first thought upon unwrapping the sandwich was in the tradition of Ween, \"Where'd the cheese go?\"  Thoughts upon first bite: \"Seasoned steak?  Seasoned with air?\"  Unfortunately, there were only about two bites that hinted that, somewhere under all the tasteless steak, there might be a slice or two of provolone.  Peppers and onions also lacked flavor, making this a disappointing sub overall.  The key to a cheesesteak for me is to interlace the cheese with the meat, so that every bite delivers flavor.\n\nAs for Betty, while she was disappointed that I hadn't enjoyed my sub, she admitted that her Chicken Barbecue sub from Al's was, and I quote, \"lame.\"",

I had never gotten a pedicure before (and only one manicure) and was a little squeamish about the idea of someone getting up close and personal with my toes but decided to see what all the fuss was about.  A friend of mine went there regularly.  \n\nThe place looked clean and the massaging chair was nice.  The technician talked me into getting a simultaneous manicure.  When I put my feet in the foot bath my skin nearly burned off!  It was REALLY hot which I guess is a good thing.  Still, I needed some convincing (OK, the technician held my feet down) to dip my feet in and keep them there.  \n\nThe manicure and pedicure were...OK, I guess.  Sorry, I don't have much to base it on since I don't get my nails done regularly.  I would've gone there again though.\n\nExcept...about a week later I noticed a cluster of 3 little dots on the bottom of my heel.  I thought it was a callous and ignored it.  But, it kept growing.  A plantar wart hurts and has little black dots inside so it couldn't be one, right? \n\nFinally, it got to the point where I thought someone was gonna call the CDC on me.  I saw a nurse who confirmed that it was a plantar wart.  A couple of months and two bottles of Dr's Scholl's wart remover later and it was finally gone.  \n\nThere is no way I could've gotten it from anywhere other than the nail salon.  I don't frequent any pools or locker rooms.  Sadly, this experience will probably prevent from getting a pedicure ever again.",

I went this weekend with a small group and had great service, very good wine recommendations (really awesome Gruner Veltliner...and not expensive at all at $32 btl)  Out of 12 different plates at the table, only 1 would I not order again: Farro, not bad just a touch sweeter for a few of us at the table, and this is nitpicking for a fair review's sake.  The other 11 were really fantastic: Cauliflower, Egg in a jar, Duck Liver Terrine, Pig's Head, Peas & Favas, Sunckoke Chowder, Duck Breast.  \n\nBest of the best: \n\n(1)  Sweetbreads-- were an amazing spin on pub-style hot wings with celery and blue cheese (but very high quality version and ingredients).\n\n(2)  Radish Toast-- best single bite of the evening for a few and it was done simply with radish, toast, shimeji mushrooms and lardo.  Ok, i'm a sucker for pork fat and all things Japanese but seriously...this is good food.  We ordered another!\n\nReally nice work by the whole staff.  Bar tenders do really good work with cocktails as well.  They'll make egg drinks and the classics are done the right way.  Order a beer and it goes into the proper glass and it's poured properly as well (watch them pour a Julius Echter, you'll appreciate the care given, like they do from the time you walk in.)\n\nKendall Square has a winner, here!  Check them out soon.\n\nOh, they give you crispy chicken skin instead of bread to snack on!!  come on, that's just love in my book...",

AND the HEIGHT! How many ice cream parlors do you know you walk in and it's not low-focused, as if trying to keep your attention straight ahead? Not many.  But the flowery hearts on the walls, the stringed lights, and the interesting decor have you yearning to see more! You're always looking up and around.\n\n  The candies & apples are finely decorated and placed, in my opinion very clever how they are so near the door but without being in your face. I loved the nostalgic puppets they have and sat and played with the ''Lambchop'' puppet. If I had a child, we would have had oodles of fun sitting there and talking about how I use to watch it back in the day .\n\n  The hot chocolate is out of this world, I'd even say great enough to try even in the summer! Hot, moderately thick and full of flavor I melted to! Even my husband was very impressed, and he tends to have a very selective perspective with businesses, so I thank the staff for making him laugh so and being so cheerful! They had pleasant humor that this world needs more with their businesses. Youthful, but professional which is JUST what more businesses need in this day in age to remind us what service REALLY is and should be.\n\n  I'd have to disagree with ANYone feeling that the service of the girls here is anything short of efficient, kind, and always with a customer-friendly and attentive drive out of the corner of their eye, even their age considering (teenage to young college females). There were multiple questions I had about the place here, and not once was I brushed off or ignored as they would pass by. In fact, twice I'd noticed two different girls would just stop what they were doing and actually stepped up to me to ask if everything was alright (also, considering it was somewhat busy upon entering, this was also impressive to me.)\n\n  So, excellent service, a great place for the next G.N.O, great date spot, great finish up after a dinner at the Atlantic Station and a refreshing atmosphere that this world needs. These are the Pros.\n\n  The Cons: I wish I'd had more money to afford to try a bit more, but in the end, it really just encourages me to go back next time I'm around. And I would recommend the place to anyone with a sense of humor, style, and inner child that they care to indulge once in a while!",

                    "text": "One of the things that's always annoyed me about using Yelp as a litmus test when deciding to check out a new place, is that you really can't trust any reviews in a college area. \n\nThe vast majority of college kids suck at food reviews, because they're comparing Pizza Hut (FIVE STARS!) with other discriminating food choices like the box of Pop Tarts they bought at Walgreens and have been living off of during finals week*.\n\nAlternatively, you get whiny diatribes about how the service took FOUR MINUTES, meanwhile providing absolutely no details about the food.\n\nNeedless to say, I approached Longhorn Po Boy with much trepidation. AND LONGHORN PO BOY SLAPPED THAT TREPIDATION OUT OF MY MOUTH AND REPLACED IT WITH AN AWESOME Mediterranean burger; a moist beef wonderland dripping with tabbouleh and Tzatziki and Feta, rivaling the Mediterranean in its herculean size and girth**. Different AND amazingly good.\n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, there aren't any Po Boys on the menu. This is a Mediterranean / American grill fusion-ey lunch counter. It's also lunch counter goddamn-heaven.\n\nNot horribly hungry? They offer low-priced plates --many under $5-- some as simple as a plate of hummus, feta and olives with a side of pita bread. You can routinely feed two for around $12-$18.\n\nThe Gyros are HUGE and greasy and ingredients are all high-quality. They offer a ton of veggie options: two of my favorites are the Salmon sandwich with capers, and the \"Green Goblin\", a spinach wrap with avocado, jalapenos, hummus, spinach, tabbouleh and a few other green-colored odds-n-ends. \n\nTheir Falafel isn't the best I've ever had in the whole world ever ever ever, but it's by no means off-putting. I could easily see myself ordering it again sometime. It lacks a certain sour quality, even with pickles. This is probably due to their hot sauce being a homemade concoction that is great for those that love chili-style hot, but I personally prefer RedHot on Falafel...the lack of that sour/vinegar bite from RedHot is probably what's missing.\n\nThe fries vary from being forgettable to amazing. When I stop wanting to put ketchup on fries and eat them plain, that's a warning sign the fries are good.\n\nWith such a huge variety on the menu, and great breakfast options right next door at the co-owned Lava-Lava*** coffee shop (competent breakfast tacos --till 2pm on weekends!-- and decent smoothies.), this would probably be the place I spent most of my time if I were going to UT, and being right off Red River, it's a great stop if you work in the area and have a full lunch hour****\n\n\n\n* EG: The Spicy Pickle? Really?!?\n\n **ew!\n\n*** This is a typo --it's actually Lava *Java*-- but it sounds like something out of Mario Brothers so I'm leaving it.\n\n**** wait time can vary...I think most people have simply forgotten that a good lunch counter takes longer than the insta-food franchises out there. That said, if you come during a lunch rush, you're screwed.\n\n\n\nedit: closed? NoOOOoooOooooooOOOOo[/vadar]",

One thing I learned is that the burger is only as good as the toppings you choose to add. All toppings (except for cheese and bacon) are free! However, the toppings were not cooked the best. I was asked if I would like my onions grilled or not. I requested mine to be grilled. When my burger arrived though, the onions looked cooked, but certainly not grilled, or even sauteed (not well, anyway). They were clear and smooth, without any sign of being exposed to high heat. As expected, they were pretty bland (they didn't even seem seasoned). The same was for the mushrooms. It's as if the raw veggies were just steamed. The raw green peppers did not make my burger any better, but that was partly my mistake. \nCriticism of toppings aside, the burger patty itself was very good. It was hand formed upon ordering and smashed on the hot surface to get a good sear. \nThe fries are huge. Do not order a large unless you plan to share it between two or three people. They were crispy and fresh, but the Cajun seasoning was a bit too salty for my tastes.\nTo summarize, the burger is a pretty god deal, being only around $3.60 for a single without cheese and bacon. While Five Guys has the potential to make a good burger, your overall burger is only as good as the toppings you add, so choose wisely!",

It is a custom build your own burger type of a place which I thought was pretty cool, and it didn't seem pretentious or wanna-be ethnic like some of the rest of the eateries in Claremont.\n\nThis is what we ordered:\n\nTurkey burger with a wheat bun, american cheese, pesto mayo dressing, and a hamburger combo, with jack cheese, jalape\u00f1os, thousand island, saut\u00e9ed onions and a white bun (I know my fianc\u00e9 has some weird taste in food sometimes!). The combo came with a drink and fries (sweet potato fries are an option but we didn't get them this time), and we ordered an extra drink....which came to about $15.00 (very inexpensive)\n\nThey brought the food to our table, and it was hot, fresh, and extremely good....the turkey patty was seasoned very well, and the pesto mayo was very good. The hamburger was also very good, it was super juicy and fresh. The fries were seasoned, not too crispy, they were perfect. \n\nI noticed comments about the prices being too high and the lack of quality in the meat....I am guessing they have lowered their prices and got better quality of meat since? I know they also have a student special, a burger, fries and drink for $5.00, seems like a pretty good deal to me.\n\nI would give them 5 stars if not for the insane colours painted on the walls.

It's the boat on Foothill, on an otherwise relatively fancy-looking street.\n\nI am not sure anyone goes to Sushi Cruise not intending to get the All You Can Eat deal! Lunch is $18.95 and dinner is  a few dollars more ($22.95?) for three (or four) rounds of sushi. I am not certain because the order sheet they give you has columns for 4 rounds, but I have never made it past the 3rd one!\n\nThe AYCE menu includes nigiri sushi, kitchen items like tempura and miso soup, baked/cooked rolls, and specialty rolls. Some of those rolls/nigiri can be pricey a la carte, so make sure you order some! The last time I went the salmon was especially fatty and soft. The specialty and baked rolls can be pretty interesting and very tasty, especially when smothered in sweet eel sauce. The sushi is not exceptionally high-quality, but it has never been bad in all the years I've been coming.\n\nIt is really very easy to make up the price you pay for AYCE - three of us ordered a rough total of 15 nigiri orders and 7 rolls and we well outmatched the $69+tip lunch tab. That included a couple hot teas, which are not complimentary but are very cheap.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is very warm, fun, and friendly. At lunch it is low-key and sunny; at night it is usually very lively and can get loud. There are several big screen TVs on the walls. The walls are plastered with fun pictures of groups and people having a good time; I'm pretty sure I'm on there at least once from a friend's birthday! The staff is very inviting and friendly and want to make sure you have a good time.",

                    "text": "My wonderful BF took me here last night as a belated V-day celebration dinner and I have to say I was really disappointed.  Now I need to clarify, I certainly wasn't disappointed in him planning an evening out, and as far as BF's go Chris is Boss!  But...Fondue Fred's is lacking in many things.  \n\nFirst of all, we are kinda Fondue freaks!  Not only have we been to all the fondue places that we know of in the bay area, we also make fondue at home for friends and when we just feel like eating some cheese.  Fondue Fred's is nothing like La Fondue or even a chain fondue place like Melting Pot.  \n\nThe restaurant was staffed by what seemed a family, and some illegals who spoke ZERO english...as in not even enough to understand my request for more water.  Secondly, the fondue only comes with Bread, unless you pay extra to get mushrooms, veggies and or apples.  EXTRA for stuff to dip besides just crusty bread...to me that is LAME with a capital L!  \n\nThe fondue pots are not electric, so the cheese ends up gelatinous and then what's the point of even eating it.  They have these cheesy little flames underneath the pots, and no fancy cheese mixes at all.  I will say that the Asiago cheese fondue was yummy...but once again it didn't stay hot and liquid but became more of a goo.  \n\nThe waitress had family come in, and basically sat down and had dinner with them while leaving all of us paying customers with no server whatsoever!  We decided not to even have dessert, because we didn't want to get up and get it ourselves. \n\nIf you are looking for good fondue, please don't waste your money here, go to Melting Pot, or the Fondue place in SF, and if you want TOP OF THE LINE fondue head down to La Fondue in Saratoga.",

Lets step outside our comfort zones! I suggested Jacks n Joe after reading the reviews and surprisingly I was able to get the crew on board!  \n\nThe place is so cute! It looks like a page out of the Ikea catalog haha.. the food was delicious! I had the banana walnut pancakes. The order comes with 3 pancakes, tons of bananas and walnuts on top. I ordered eggs on the side. The rest of my party got the Totally LA pancakes which looked so good, the house special of the month which was the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake pancakes, (they looked great but, holy sugar!) and the rest of my crew all had the Combo 1 special which comes with 2 buttermilk pancakes, eggs, bacon or sausage and breakfast potatos. Add 5 cups of coffee, 2 hot chocolates, and 1 juice to that and that completes our order. Between 7 of us, we paid a total of $82 including tip which I didn't think was too bad for the amount of food we had. I think the serving sizes are HUGE. Only finished a pancake and a half and I didn't eat again until 8pm. \n\nThe down side is the parking lot. It's small and the spaces are reduced, but they say they have parking in the back and you can always park at the 7-11 lot next door. \n\nI'm definitely coming back!",

                    "text": "Like many others, my boyfriend and I got the Groupon to this place.  We came here today for brunch to use it.  We intended to just pick up a bunch of pastries, but they didn't have a huge selection and some of the hot sandwiches sounded good, so we decided on an angelo (proscuitto and arugula) for him and a buffarella (buffalo mozzarella, tomato, basil) for me, as well as a chocolate croissant to share.  \n\nThe guy who was taking the orders rudely held the Groupon in my face and said in a really loud voice \"NOT GOOD FOR LUNCH FOOD\" (which it does say on it).  When I responded that I didn't realize and we'd rethink our order, he said he would do it just this once but said with a sneer \"don't ever do it again!\"  It was nice of him to take it for lunch when he didn't have to, but honestly, he was kind of a jerk about it.  I thought the people at the counter also seemed super impatient that we didn't know what we wanted -- sorry we've never been before!!   So, no points for service.\n\nThe chocolate croissant was fantastic but not cheap ($2.50).  The pastry itself was good but not great, but I loved the chocolate sauce (its more like a sauce than a bar) inside, and the fact that it was dipped in chocolate.   Our sandwiches were pretty mediocre for the price ($8-9 for a small sandwich with no sides, except a bite-sized fruit tart).    I swear the mozzarella on my sandwich wasn't buffalo mozzarella.  It really tasted like normal, cow mozzarella to me, and didn't seem super fresh.  I've had much, much better mozzarella elsewhere.   It wasn't bad but it was nothing exceptional, and a small portion for the price I thought.   My bf felt similarly about his sandwich.\n\nBottom line: Fun to try, no burning desire to come back, and if I did I would stick to the pastries!",

Admittedly, I did request it extra crusty, because most places don't take the time to let the crust develop in their frenzied rush to serve the crowd of folks waiting impatiently outside. How would it have been cooked if I hadn't requested it that way? Who knows. But props for entertaining my request and cooking it right. The eggs were over easy as ordered, the orange juice was ice cold, and the price was right.\n\nA few constructive comments: Cash only sucks in this day and age, especially when I can't keep track of what I spend my money on unless it's captured on my credit card statement. To the hostess, if you choose to sit me down at a table that still has dirty dishes on it, make sure to have it wiped down. Sure it was mostly clean, but there was a tiny puddle of coffee from the previous diner--kinda gross. Also, it took a smidge longer than one might expect for the waitress to come around, but when I flagged her down she was more than happy to take my order.\n\nLastly, the overall wait for a table wasn't too bad: I would say maybe 15 minutes mid-morning on a beautiful Sunday in September. Isn't that primo brunching time? Although, with the Steelers playing at home, I'm guessing a large chunk of their usual crowd was probably tailgating...",

Part  2 will review the bar aspect of this establishment.\n\nPart 1 - The Restaurant: I remember coming here for the lunch/dinner special as an undergraduate. My friends and I used to get the friend chicken for like $5 dollars or something. This was in spring of 2006 so I don't know if they do it anymore. Damn, 2006 was so long ago. I am getting old.\n\nI was just here on Saturday night (9/5/09) getting hot wings and beer with my friends during the Cal Maryland game. The restaurant was packed yet we got really great service. Our waitress was spectacular. But when I got home, I got an upset stomach. I don't know if it was from the wings, the pitcher of beer I chug, the crepe from that crepe place on telegraph, or the combination of the three. I knew I was going to pay for it.\n\nPart 2 The Bar: It's a mix of UC Berkeley students and the east bay crowd. Bartenders are quite quick at getting out your drinks. The people you meet here can be so-so. I don't know what it is but it seems the most cliquish and shyest Berkeley students congregate here. If you want to meet a co-ed for the night here, try somewhere else. Most you aren't interested in making new friends. You'll find the friendlier co-eds at Co-op parties. \n\nBut the east bay crowd for some reason like to make conversation. This might be due to the fact they drink a lot more than the students. I guess having no schoolwork to do does make a difference.",

And the heat...well, it is undeniable how much it helps me sink deeper into some poses.  For me, these classes compliment the slower, more technical and complex vinyasa classes I take at other studios.  Learn the basics of each pose and the mind-body connection that defines yoga elsewhere, but come to Prana Power Yoga for a sweaty, athletic, butt-kicking workout.\n\nThe studio is a clean, open, and bright loft space with interesting light fixtures to gaze up at and new hardwood floor to ground into.  I had a hard time finding a focal point on any of the walls, which threw off some of my poses, but my balance was also hindered by the various limbs from other people waving around mere inches away from me.  Other reviewers are spot on when they talk about how crowded it is here!  I have been to a lot of other studios that get packed and they use the same sticker method to help line up mats with even space between them.  However, I have NEVER seen such little space between each mat and each row.  If there was a law for this type of thing, Prana would definitely be breaking it.  Tall person in front of you?  Watch out for their feet flying back towards your face during a fast-paced flow.  Trying to use a block for your half moon?  Good luck finding a place to put it down.  Half of the challenge of the classes here involves maneuvering around other people.   \n\nBut aside from how crowded it can get, I'm kind of into the bootcamp-esque breathing instructions and no-nonsense attitude here.  Every so often that's what I need.",

                    "text": "I'm definitely not the first LA foodie to write about this increasingly popular new gastropub adjacent to the USC campus. The Lab has taken the Trojan Nation by storm, luring students away from the all-too-familiar 9-0 and 29th Street Caf\u00e9 by promising hungry and, truthfully, thirsty co-eds carefully thought-out and deliciously prepared offerings, an impressive selection of well-chosen beer and wine, and an attractive communal space to socialize and speculate. Think back to The Max from Saved by the Bell; this neon-hued, multi-functional burger joint was the \"it\" place for Zack Morris and his posse of big-haired, high-riding classmates to see and be seen while enjoying the best burgers and fries that the neighborhood around California High School had to offer. The Lab enjoys many of these same features - a hot crowd of extroverted and educated socialites, newly-minted favorites such as Grilled Salmon with Middle East Couscous, Artichoke Fritters and Beef Sliders, and a centralized location to tantalize even the students hailing from North University Park area. My recent visits have seen samplings of Seared Ahi Salad, Caprese Flatbread, Stir-Fried Shrimp and Eight-Grain Salad, accompanied by the likes of Nobilo Sauvignon Blanc, Trojan Blonde and Samuel Adams Seasonal Ale. All were surprisingly inventive, satisfying flavorful and modestly portioned for pub fare, and everything was pleasantly well priced for those of us on a limited, pathetically self-funded budget. However, in a battle of the educational eateries, The Lab takes the cake for two all-important reasons: drinks and \"discresh.\" The fact that you can drink your discretionary funds away with the Red Trolley Ale - all thanks to your USC student ID - is revolutionary enough to send The Max back to the 80's. Sorry, Zack, there's a new hangout in town, and while it doesn't have a jukebox, it's got something your all-of-seventeen years have yet to see: lots and lots of alcohol.",

                    "text": "Cafe Luna no doubt has THE best brunch in Cambridge. Everything is fresh including the corned beef hash, which is really difficult to order from a restaurant and have it not be out of a can. Waffles, pancakes, eggs Benedict, sausages, etc. you can't really go wrong. Luna has a solid sandwich & salad menu with really good lentil soup and chili. Wine and beer are sold here. Smoothies are good and the hot chocolate is hands down the best you will ever have! The pastries in the front case are really good, although they don't always look as appealing as they taste. \n\nThe reason I give Luna five stars is because of the spacey staff, wait time and lack of dinner options. The wait staff is really nice, but can be really spacey and take a while to fulfill simple requests. It's been the same way since the place opened. However, once you've been going there long enough, it just becomes part of the scene because the food outweighs everything. \n\nIt's also really difficult to just walk in during the weekend to enjoy a meal. Now you have to call in advanced for brunch and they have a 10 minute hold. I miss the quieter days, but I'm happy that the business is doing well. The only good dinner option is the pizza, which isn't served everyday. The lasagna is flavorless. And I think I've tried something else, but it was just as flavorless and therefore, not memorable. Oh, and they used to serve the best gellato that I've ever tasted (better than anything you'll find in the North End or elsewhere), but problems with the freezer case and the new design caused them to get rid of it. I wish they still sold it. \n\nCafe Luna = good for a scheduled brunch or laidback lunch.",

I'm not exaggerating. You can see the cheese on each slice being stretched from the sides as it's being pulled away from the whole pie like in those commercials. But in real life. In front of your eyes! They don't just do that in commercials!\n\nI stand with Fat Slice because I love her saucy red tomato sauce. I love her piled with veggies. I love those shiny pepperonis. I love the cheese oozing off of her. I love her with a coke. I love her for $2.75.\n\nSeriously. I love everything about Fat Slice. I love that the neon lights pull me in. I love that there is a long corridor of seating. I love that the unpretentious top 40 is on. I love that I feel like a teenager in love when I'm eating here with my boy and turning the pages of the East Bay Express transparent from the touch of our greasy fingers.

We parked our car via their valet parking, the wait was long for a valet and they were not careful with my car ending up with several small \"dings\" that weren't there before.  The room was not very large and we immediately noticed that the air conditioning was not working, it was summer and hot in the room.  I called the concierge who spoke very poor English and I didn't understand a word she said even after having her repeat her sentence.  Before leaving for dinner we reported the air conditioning to the front desk who assured us it would be fixed by the time we returned from dinner.  After dinner we went to Waterfire and got back to the hotel late.  The a/c was still not working, but we were tired and decided not to complain again.  The faucets in the bathroom leaked all over the counter and the exhaust fan was not working.  As I got pulled the covers to get into bed I noticed that the sheets did not fit, there were three twin sheets on a king bed that were so inadequate that they were not even able to be tucked in.  I couldn't wait to leave and thankfully it was only a one-night stay.  As we checked out the front desk did not even ask if we enjoyed our stay.  I asked who I could complain to and they actually had a little card with a name and number on it for complaints (guess they get a lot).  The person I called was sympathetic and the cost of the room was refunded, but I would have preferred a room without the problems and would never stay at a Westin again.",

I think we sharked for a parking lot for a good full 40-45 minutes before we got lucky and got a spot right on the side of the building. Most frustrating thing ever. It's almost like trying to find parking at ACC - Northridge in the afternoon.\n\nAfter that whole ordeal, we were seated promptly and the waitress tended to us. It was a busy night because of the UT game going on that night but she managed it pretty well. The chips and salsa came out as we ordered our drinks and food. Mmmmm, hot spicy salsa. Wish more places offered it instead of calling it spicy and it's not even spicy at all. I'm a big wimp too. \n\nWe all ordered Mexican Martinis or Strawberry Margaritas and some entrees. I know what my order was and not theirs. I had their Green Chilli Chicken Rellenos (dunno if it was Green Chili Pastor Rellenos.....). \n\nThe drinks came out and oh my god. I love their Margaritas. Their martinis were ok. \n\nMy food came out and I fell in love with it! I was expecting some cruddy Chili's like Tex-Mex food. Nope, mine packed with a lot of flavors and more important, a good kick for my taste buds. Delicious! Pair it with a margarita and man, I was really bloated. Plus the unlimited salsa and chips. Jeeze. I was in heaven.\n\nI will be coming here again but probably the one closer to home on Burnet Rd up North.\n\nCraving a margarita now as I am typing this. Highly recommended!",

I don't really mind that, just don't charge me for freshly squeezed.  \nI also ordered some hummus to go with my lemonade.  What I got was this ice-cold red dip that kinda looked like hummus.

I go and ask the girl if their wi-fi is password protected, and she just shrugs and leaves.  Then I ask the guy behind the bar, and he tells me some \"funny\" story before finally telling me nobody knows whats wrong with it.  \n\nI drink my lemonade and leave utterly disappointed.

I liked the pink and green plastic tubes that hung on some of the tables like you could find on retro lawn chairs. It definitely had a nice vibe.\n\nOur table, which included Jen R, decided to the Diego Rivera tasting menu.  Here are some highlights (or lowlights, in my case):\n- The salad had a cream-like dressing, olives, oranges, and pecans (which were delicious). I just thought that was an odd combo.\n- Jeff loved the mushroom flatbread. I thought it was \"eh.\"\n- The chicken tacos were the least favorite of the table. All you could taste was the smokiness of the dish.  \n- The rabbit dish was delicious, but there were only 2 small pieces per dish. The black beans were way off and had no flavor.\n- The saving grace to the steak was the sauce on top. Jeff really liked the corn risotto. \n- I'm not a big fan of flan but it was one of the better ones I've ever had. Needless to say, Jeff ate both of ours.\n\nIf it wasn't for the guacamole and chips, I would have been starving. I just thought everything was OK, nothing with a major wow factor. \n\nAfter the tasting, I ordered the churros equating hot fried dough with sugar on top as the saving grace.

Last time I was in LA, they still had their rewards program (one of those stamp cards, get 10 get one free kind of thing). Great location, cozy atmosphere, and a very student friendly business. Wonderful place to catch up with old friends (like when visiting your alma mater) but also an awesome place to hunker down and study (right next to the fuel line of milk tea - the best finals fuel ever)!\n\nI like to the basics at a place to assess them (because if they can't do basic coconut/almond milk black tea, why bother?) This place passes with flying colors, and consistently delivers. \n\nLIQUID SELECTION: They have a good selection of both milk teas and slushy smoothies. Their milk tea isn't watery or powdery. I think their green tea is a tiny bit on the sweet side, but I like my green tea plain anyway. Also, I believe they are one of the few places that serves HOT boba tea. \n\nBOBA/PEARLS: Their boba itself is perfect, not too squishy but not hard. The only place with better boba/bubbles/pearls was Green Tea Terrace, but alas, they closed in Westwood and only had ice cream and tea flavors. No *milk* tea there. Sad. \n\n\nBIG PRO: I'm lactose intolerant and this place never gave my stomach any issues (they must use a non-dairy creamer or something). \nFree wireless @ Boba Loca doesn't hurt at all either. Just grab the password from the guys behind the register after/during your purchase. \n\nCONS: The only cons are 1) it might be hard to grab a seat since it's often crowded, 2)their seats are really close together  and 3)their electrical outlets are few and far between.\n\nOverall, I have fond memories of this place and wish we had something half as good in DC!",

Voila, you have yourself a CREAM masterpiece. I had the Turtle cookie and the mint chocolate chip ice cream in between. Delish.

So the Men's locker area is clean but outdated.  The shower is old and they only had conditioner and body wash but no shampoo.    The sink area had shaving cream but no razors.   A hairbrush, but no disinfectant.  The water they served tasted bad.  They definitely need to invest in bottled water or filtered water. \n\nOnce we were done with the steam room we were waiting in a small sit down area for our massages.  The massage people came out and introduced themselves.  Very friendly and made you feel comfortable.  My massage therapists name was Andrew and he did a mixture of Shiatsu and some stretching techniques which were awesome.  No complaints on the massage.  \n\nGiven the spa locker room is outdated, but the main thing we came for is the massages which were really good.\n\nOnce our massage was done they escorted us to a quiet room where  they gave us white wine and famous amos cookies.  Wine was okay but they could  have given something better than Famous Amos.  They also said we were all out of chocolate which should have come with the wine.  We went on a Friday so one would think you would keep your supplies full for the weekend coming up.\n\nAnyways the important thing was the massage which was great.",

And Bob Marley interior decorating... alright, this seems pretty Austin-y, let's go.\"  \n\nAfter having dinner, we will NOT go, ever again.  We ordered the Chicken Montego Bay, despite worries that pineapple would not go well in a hot pasta.  Since the meal cost $13, and we are college students (read: poor), we decided to split it.\n\nFirst came the salad, if you would like to call it that.  I would like to call it a chunk of iceberg lettuce directly taken from an HEB bag, doused with a huge (1/8 bottle) amount of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing.  I passed on the salad and let my friend have it; she took one bite and set it to the side. \n\nThen was the pasta.  They did split it into 2 plates, for which they charged us $2.  The Montego Bay pasta consists of jerk chicken, pineapple, basil, and fresh vegetables.  It was majority bell peppers in an excess of very salty sauce.  The one positive note was that the portion size was HUGE, neither one of us could finish half of an order.  \n\nThe waitress we had seemed less than thrilled with her job.  She slammed the dishes on our table in the same manner as an angry bagger at the grocery store will shove your bread into the bottom of a bag and then throw a ton of heavy cans on top of it.  \n\nI don't blame her.  If i had to serve sub-par, overpriced food to people with an increasing number of reasons to not tip the waiter, I'd be pissed too.  \n\nI've heard it's pretty good and better prices for lunch.  I'm not going back to find out.",

As another reviewer mentioned, it's really nice to be able to eat out and not have to worry about the waiter not really knowing what vegetarian means, or accidentally finding a piece of hamburger in your pasta. I've tried it twice now and have been disappointed both times. The first time I went, I tried the tempeh hot wings, which were good, but the rest of what I ordered was so-so.\n\nWhen I went the other day, I had the pasta special. The waitress told me there were no onions in the dish, which I then had to pick out once the dish came out with onions in it. It was also one of the spiciest dishes I've ever had (I was warned that it was a little spicy). I could barely eat it. I asked for a piece of bread, which I found out when I got my check that they charged me 50 cents for. I also got a ho-hum salad to start, but it came with a very small cup of dressing. I asked for extra dressing, only to find out when I got the check that they charged me 50 cents for the extra dressing. Not a very good marketing strategy on their part... I might have considered trying the restaurant again, since I want to support a vegetarian restaurant, but I'm not going to go back to a place that charged me 50 cents for enough dressing to cover my lettuce. Especially since the portions were already reasonably small and the dishes were overpriced. It's too bad.",

Many's the weekend I would spend packing a lunch on my spring-loaded bike rack, pedalling down to the Natural History Museum. I'd lock up my bike in the bike rack, and then spend the whole day wandering through the halls and soaking up all the knowledge there.\n\nPrehistoric animal skeletons, dioramas showing life in Los Angeles 35,000 years ago, jewels and polished rocks, models of planets -- oh, just all kinds of things that fascinated me! The building itself was a fascination. It was my private adventure. And while in the park I'd visit the Science Expo, the Armory, and the Sunken Rose Garden. \n\nTimes have changed since then. Then, a weekend meant light attendance, everything was peaceful, and everything was free. Instead of a McDonald's in the Science Expo building selling crap, there was the downstairs cafeteria in the Museum, with its wonderful murals, selling tasty hot food.\n\nNow, everything costs, and the park is filled with families having picnics and playing soccer. Very different from my time. But the Museum is still there, better than ever, and you need to go spend a day soaking it up!\n\nPAYMENT: Adults $9; Seniors (62+) $6.50; Kids 13-17 $6.50; Kids under 5 FREE\n\nPARKING SITUATION: Reasonably large pay lots",

The only one I make a point to stay away from is the Everything, as it tastes like Everything, If You Consider Salt To Be Everything There Is. They also put a metric ton of cream cheese on, which can either be a delicious value or an unnecessary mess to scrape off depending on your leanings.\n\nThe Black & White cookie is worth the hype. The coffee is also fairly good and screaming hot. I haven't ventured to the salad bar yet, but they have a veritable cornucopia of veggies and dressings.

When handing you your subpoena-like menu, the waiter says \"you have been served.\"  Furthermore, all of the items are either named for legal cases, laws, or famous judges or lawyers.  \n\nFor the food, the menu is extensive and there are many unique choices.  Not every pub fries their potato chips to order, makes their own pastrami, or uses chipotle aioli.  I tried the Em O, the fried pickles, and they were delicious- served with a very hot, but cool, chipotle aioli.  I ordered the Oliver Wendell Holmes, a sandwich of 2 crab cakes, garlic aioli, canadian bacon, and the fixings- it was delicious, though my one complaint was the cakes were a tad salty- nothing too bad, though.  My brother got a monster of a burger- cheese, canadian bacon, all on rye bread- it too was very good but a little too brown to truly be medium, still it was very juicy.  My dad ordered the pastrami sandwich with red cabbage slaw- it was delicious.  Although, it got even better with a side of grainy brown mustard, something I think they should include on the plate without having to ask for.  \n\nOverall this was delicious pub food at a reasonable price.  The atmosphere was great and I just dig this place's style.  I know it's picky but I would like a little better presentation for the dishes- there's nothing wrong with the simple presentation I received, but if the presentation matched the taste, this place would be perfect.",

I've been here before for dinner and found service to be somewhat uneven (waiter walking away too quickly before you get to ask questions, water service not great, etc), but brunch... brunch is a special thing.\n\nIt is wonderfully quiet for brunch (possibly due to the price tag - $35/two courses - but it's worth it). The quiet let us have a chance to take in and enjoy the peace of the beautiful views by the window. There was classical music over a set of speakers, and I felt happier just being there. \n\n(Note for view-seekers - they will offer you the balcony seating outside, but they don't have umbrellas outside, which is tricky to accept in the hot summer sun. The views inside facing north are not quite as stunning as the views outside facing south, but they're pretty nice, and they'll also let you wander outside and explore the balcony after your meal if you wish.)\n\nBrunch service is attentive and every single detail of the food preparation is perfect. The formality here is *not* stuffy the way it can be at dinner - it's just nice.\n\nWaffles came out on lovely heated white plates, decorated with splashes of top-notch fruit (also warmed), and with maple syrup heated up as well. The strip steak, prepared with a red wine demiglace, was tender and delicious, with a nice sear on the outside, making the wine sauce come together really well. I also had a creme brulee that made my eyes roll up in my head - the vanilla was intense, and the custard served in a nice shallow dish, allowing for the maximum crisp texture of caramel to come through with the custard.\n\nIn conclusion: wow brunch. It's the top-notch restaurant at brunch that it is sadly not at dinner. \n\n(The review is 5 stars for brunch, but it's about 3 stars for dinner, given its price range, so I'm averaging the two).",

I am a local, my family has been here for generations.  I have tried Louisa's twice and I will never return.  My first trip to the diner I ordered the veggie omelet, which ended up being tasteless.  No fresh ingredients, only a frozen veggie medley from a bag undercooked and thrown inside the eggs.  I was really disappointed considering I was visiting \"The best breakfast in SLO.\"  I shrugged it off as one bad experience and decided that my wife and I would give it another go in the future.\n\nThis morning we gave Louisa's another chance.  We came in and sat at the counter.  After 10 - 15 minutes we were finally addressed by the staff.   After another 10 - 15 minutes we finally were able to place our order.  30 minutes later my wife's food came out along with another patrons who came in after we had ordered.  I encouraged my wife to enjoy here breakfast while it was hot and she began to eat.  Half way through her breakfast our server came back to inform me they were out of ingredients for my order.  I ordered another item.  It came out 15 minutes later, my wife was done with her breakfast, but the food was not cooked.  My potatoes were brittle and not done.  My omelet was sitting in a pool of grease.  I sent it back and asked for the check.  \n\nLouisa's I dub you the worst breakfast in San Luis Obispo County.  \n\nEveryone should go to the Honeymoon cafe in Pismo.",

And Sunrise Biscuit Kitchen is one of the places that I miss the most (followed closely by Bojangles and Biscuitville, of course). \n\nSunrise Biscuit Kitchen was always my artery-clogging food vendor of choice on Saturday or Sunday mornings/afternoons after a typical college weekend night of drinking and debauchery. Their biscuits always hit the spot, soaking up whatever liquor was still sloshing around in my empty stomach. They've got huge servings for a good price, so it's not a surprise that all my college friends, from UNC-CH, NCState, etc., loved this place. \n\nThe sweet tea was delicious. A little on the sweet side, but if you let it sit for a few minutes, the melted ice will water down the sugar and you will be left with the perfect level of sweetness. \n\nThey've got a pretty good selection on their menu, with most of the standard southern biscuit food fare, but I was always partial to their fried chicken biscuit combo (drink and hash brown side). Maybe not for the excessive-grease-averse, but otherwise, it's the best fried chicken biscuit I've ever had, no questions asked (Bojangle's chicken biscuit pales in comparison). Crispy on the outside, hot and moist on the inside. I'm also a fan of tomato and cheese sandwiches, so I'd often build my own biscuit. \n\nI never thought to order anything sweet from them, but after hearing about the merits of the cinnamon role, I think I'll give it a try the next time I go to SBK.",

The rice, egg, and other assorted finely sliced vegetables came out sizzling in a hot stone bowl, with chili paste on the side. The entree also comes with miso soup and several sides (mung bean sprouts, spicy daikon, and spicy cucumber slices the night I visited). I'd agree that the prices are rather high for Pittsburgh, but what I got was plenty of food.\n\nNevertheless, the service is the reason for my lukewarm rating. The best way I can describe the service is that all the servers seem to have extreme tunnel vision, and only appear to focus on one table at a time. Rather than bringing food to one table and then going over to other tables to check in, the servers march right back to the kitchen. They don't appear to notice that other tables look ready to order or appear to have finished eating and want their check. We spent a long time trying to catch any server's eye for our bill (our original waitress had gone MIA) before we had to be a little obnoxious. Then we waited and waited for someone to come to take our money and make change before my dining companion got up and took our bill and cash to the manager's station.\n\nLuckily, we weren't in a rush to go anywhere post-meal, but the servers' inability to multitask still tried our patience.",

Definitely not. Substandard food does not sit well with me, nor does it sit well with my bowels. If you want a good hot bowl of pho, you are going to unfortunately have to drive farther away. Go check out Pho Saigon at the Chinatown Center off of Lamar, or go to Pho Van, or to Tam Deli. The broth is what makes the pho, and those places have good broth.\n\nThis place is OUT.",

                    "text": "Went to Cafe 140 for the last day of dineLA, and I had forgotten how much I missed this place.  The layout is very much similar to when it was Crocodile Cafe with an open kitchen and nice tables.  A rundown of the very affordable 3-course meal for 2:\ngrilled artichoke - slightly smoky, and such a welcome change from the normal steamed artichoke.  Nice sauce on the side, that tastes a lot like tartar sauce\nonion rings - AMAZING.  Not breaded onion rings like the ones you get at The Hat,  A beautiful batter that is perfectly cooked, and I think the onion rings might be red onions, but they aren't too strong tasting.\nsteak & mushroom salad - really surprised me how good this was.  The mushrooms are cooked rather than raw, and the steak had tons of taste without drowning in dressing or sauce\nBBQ chicken pizza - very CPK-esqe, which is to say excellent\ncarrot cake - good.  I've had better, moister cake but the frosting was quite good\nbutterscotch pudding - awfully sweet.  Have a few bites of this, eat something else, and that something else won't taste like anything.\n\nHowever, one of the highlights has got to be sitting in Jonathan's section.  He's a terrific server who stopped by often to check on us, refilled drinks, bought Mrs. C not just hot water but lemon and honey in a dish, boxed our food and (here's the key) *even labeled it*.  In all of the times that I have gotten a box for my food, I've never had anyone label the containers.  A thoughtful touch that shows how much this guy thinks of his customers.  Excellent main dishes, and I rarely order dessert anyway, so can't wait to come back.  Kinda mad that it took me to long to try this place.",

My one complaint would be that the waiter didn't tell us we were ordering too much and that we were going to get a lot of repeat flavors.  The three of us ordered:\n\nTempura fried shrimp - came with a great ginger soy sauce and an awesome mango salsa which I wish I'd ordered a little side of for my arctic char\n\nPizza with olives and feta - OK not great not terrible\n\nCaeser Salad - Yummy!  Comes in a bowl made of parmesan cheese very well dressed.  Only problem for me is that it comes with a filet of anchovy...yuck\n\nGoat-cheese salad - Yummmy!!  Big salad with artichoke hearts and a big golf ball size ball of fried goat cheese. \n\nSeared Char - FANTASTIC!  Very flavorful fish.  Well seasoned, hot, the risotto that came with it was not very good but the fish was amazing.\n\nVeggie Napoleon - FANTASTIC!!!  Veggies were very fresh and the herbs totally popped.  Lots of goat cheese on this dish so that's where the too many repeated flavors comes in.  There was a lightly dressed salad with this dish as well.  I really liked that the dressing was different from the other salads.\n\nThe entrees came with a soup or salad and since we had so much salad already, we did soup.  The soup was FABULOUS!!!  Spicy black bean and chicken vegetable soup...it sounded too complicated but totally worked. \n\nThey have little $1.50 offerings of bites of creme brulee and pot de chocolate and cheesecake...we did the first two.  Great finish.  \n\nI'd definitely check out if in the area.",

There is plenty of seating around, so fairly big groups can gather together to eat. \n\nYou order at the register, take your number decal, and wait for your food. Because the dishes are made on the spot, it may take some time, especially if you order a meal that requires a good time to prepare, but once you are served your meal, you will soon find out it was worth the wait.\n\nAs the restaurant's name implies, your food is cooked to order, which is a big plus in my book. The dish I ordered, a  plate of chicken tenderloins and garlic-mashed potatoes, was served to me piping hot and in a generous amount. The tenderloins came out perfect, with a delicious crunchy layer outside and juicy layer inside. A honey mustard dipping sauce topped with chives is accompanied with it. The garlic-mashed potatoes were incredible; topped with chives as well, it was very well prepared; the texture was so smooth, and the garlic added an extra notch to it. In addition, the lemonade is made from scratch and was a great thirst quencher. Fresh 2 Order also offers a variety of health foods, such as energy bars and fruit drinks. I will definitely look into them the next time I visit. Menu prices are good for the quality food and service you receive.\n\nFresh food that is carefully prepared, good prices, and good service at all present at Fresh 2 Order, easily making it one of my new favorite restaurants here in Atlanta.",

I may be missing something... or UMCP needs to start representin' on Yelp.com!\n\nThe Maryland Food Collective is a godsend.  For the unacquainted, the UMCP campus is fairly massive with lots of places to eat but very few healthy options (in my opinion).  There are cafeterias located near student dorms, the Dairy, biznesses on Rte 1, and the corporate monsters in the student union (Sbarros, McD, Steak Escape, Taco Bell, etc...)  \n\nThe Maryland Food Collective (colloquially known as the Coop) is staffed and run by volunteer student workers.  They offer tons of vegetarian and vegan options.  They have a hot food line for lunch with 1-2 specialities (the plaintains are to die for).  They have a sandwich line where sandwiches are mto.  Falafel is often available.  My fave is the turkey salad with horseradish on a bagette.  They also have vegan turkey salad, vegan mayo, hummus, baba ganoush, etc...In the cold section, they have ready made burritos that are fresh and healthy from 95cents to around 2 bucks.  They have small cheese hunks, ranging from dill havarti to mushroom yogurt cheese (at least that was the selection today).  There's also an assortment of ready made sandwiches and local vegetarian/vegan foods from community establishments. In terms of snacks, they have granola, tons of dried fruits and nuts, wasabi peas...\n\nBfast: Fresh coffee, tea, with soy milk and raw sugar for you to add as you please.  Fresh bagels with a toaster oven, butter, cream cheese, soy butter.  \n\nWhat else?  There's too much to go through.  I love this place!  Hey, I've been here for 5 years already and hopefully 1 more before I'm out.  If it weren't for the Maryland Food Collective, I'd either be severely malnourished or totally obese.  Hurray, that I'm neither.  Yay for coops!",

                    "text": "A Cafe is a lone bright spot in an otherwise desolate strip of nothingness in the UWS.  Seriously, this area is the neighborhood that restaurants forgot.\n\nAt $20 and no corkage, their prix fixe dinner deal is unbeatable.  It's cheaper than cooking at home, and is certainly worth the priced paid.  Major points for the frugality and value for money.\n\nThe decor is eclectic to be charitable, and downright weird to be un-charitable.  It's cozy enough, but I made a comment that the decor was reminiscent of my stoner friend's dorm room in college.\n\nThe menu, like the decor, is also eclectic, with some questionable items.  An escargot starter with a garlic butter sauce, spiked with West Caribbean spices, had me sopping up every morsel of butter and snail juice with the complementary crusty rolls.  \n\nHowever, the scottish pheasant pate was more of a gratin and clumsily done.  Baked pears seem more of a dessert than a starter, and the grilled avocado, while I didn't try them, did not look appealing.  I couldn't fault my duck leg confit, but the accompanying cous cous seemed like an afterthought, and didn't bring much to the party. \n\nTo be fair, these guys are working under some serious restrictions.  An open air kitchen shares space with the dining room, and is about the size of a broom closet.  More impressively (or scarily), they lack a range, plancha or any flat cooking surface.  They do all the cooking with a salamander and a few small ovens, which severely limits the type of execution that they can achieve.  Unfortunately, this limitation resonates in their food, which is fairly clunky, heavy, and about as elegant as a NY Jet's Defensive lineman.   \n\nIt's obviously popular with the locals, as the place was packed on a weekday evening.  But would I travel all the way up to BFE UWS for some hot snail action?   Probably not.",

Both the hubster and I are quite fond of Vietnamese food and seek it our wherever we are, so we ate here twice during our 3 day stay. First, I really like the space, which, with its' corrugated metal walls and local art work, manages to be both urban and cozy at the same time. The guy at the counter waits tables, so he sat us, brought us water and served our food, all while taking care of other customers and running the counter very efficiently and with a smile. I had eaten a large lunch, so had the tofu summer rolls, which were great...very fresh veggies and marinated tofu, with a crunchy fried component in the center that added textural interest, served with a tasty hoisin-peanut sauce. When I looked around I noticed many other folks had ordered those tofu summer rolls, so they're very popular. I also ordered the chicken dumplings, which were excellent...tasty little fried morsels served with a sweet fish sauce dipping sauce. Doug had the bun (vermicelli rice noodle bowl) with chicken and an extra fried spring roll and said it was great...noodles a little thicker than the average that looked homemade and well marinated chicken, served with a sauce that he thought too sweet initially, but then warmed up to. Xinh Xinh has a wide range of beverages choices, from bubble teas to Vietnamese sodas, hot tea, an avocado shake, Thai iced tea, coconut juice, and that most delicious of beverages, Vietnamese drip coffee sweetened with condensed milk...rich and sweet yumminess. We had the banh mi on our second visit, which is the traditional Vietnamese baguette sandwich. We tried the roast pork pate combo and the pepper chicken, and they were both good, but not stellar. I admit to being a little spoiled by the banh mi at Dong Phuong in New Orleans, which have ruined the experience for me anywhere else. We didn't try the pho, as we don't eat beef and they don't offer the chicken variety, although they do have a vegetarian pho on the menu. I like the thought they put into everything here, from the fresh ingredients to the cute decor. They even have their own little hand drawn character...the Pho King Man...keep in mind that \"pho\" is pronounced \"fu\" and then say it out loud. You'll get it.",

First of all, this place makes you pay extra for tapioca which is very strange because tapioca has always been included in the price when I've purchased bubble tea. I almost always go to Oasis because they have consistently great tasting bubble tea at reasonable prices. However, during the recent snowmageddon my roommate and I decided we needed bubble tea. We trekked through the snow and ice (sliding along, trying not to fall) to Oasis only to have them lock the door at the EXACT moment we went to go inside. NOOOOOO! Since we had already walked all the way there, we decided just to find another bubble tea place. We looked across the street and saw Yunnie was open, so we figured we would just go there since it was open and nearby. If only we had known what a bad decision that would be. I ordered the red bean bubble tea while my roommate got just regular milk tea. To begin with, they took much longer to make our bubble tea than it usually does at Oasis or any other bubble tea place. When I finally got my bubble tea, I took a sip and it was at that awkward not cold but not hot state (lukewarm?). Also, it tasted like badly mixed powder in water.....which it probably was. It was definitely not fresh like the drinks I normally get at Oasis. Ok, so they screwed up one drink which isn't that big of a deal because everyone has off days. However, they somehow managed to mess up my roommate's drink which is incredibly easy. While she was drinking it she kept getting black hard pieces in her mouth that were almost like plastic. We thought at first maybe they were tea leaves, but they were much too hard and jagged to be tea leaves. Finally, she gave up entirely on drinking the thing for fear of ingesting too much of the unidentifiable substance. Unless you want a gross drink or one filled with an unidentifiable substance, I would suggest going across the street to Oasis.",

They were fluffy crispy on the outside, and tender and juicy n the inside, the portion was the perfect size for two to share.\n\nOn my first trip to CB I decided to forgo the faux meat selections(which there are quite a few) and opted for the Hot Schezuan Eggplant with brown rice. The sauce was delish, dark and syrupy, packed with garlic and scallions and tiny bits of tofu. SHUT UP! SO GOOD! The brown rice was the perfect accompaniment so soak up all the wonderful sauce, you know, us fat girls love the sauce. Ha ha. My only complaint was that the heat level wasn't where I expected, there was a sweet heat but not the spicy shocking heat I was expecting. Still stunning and beautiful.\n\nMy PIC choose the Mongolian Beef, and with the quickness that he devoured his entree I assume that he enjoyed it.\n\nCB menu also boasts Thai and Maylay offerings, which I will defiantly be trying on my next visit, and I plan on visiting quite a bit.",

There was nowhere to park, but most places in the area did not have dedicated parking either, so I guess that's not really that big of an issue, but should still be noted.\n\nWe read some iffy reviews of the place and were steered toward getting their staples (ribs and brisket) as it was the most consistent options. So that is what we ordered.\n\nThe brisket was the consistency of pulled pork and corned beef. It was oddly very salty and fatty. It was very strange.\n\nThe ribs were horrific. It was almost as if they cooked the ribs, and then left it under a heat lamp for 6 hours and dried them out beyond edibility. One edge was basically black from being so dried out. The meat fell right off the bone, but the meat was so dry and tough we literally could not stab a fork through it. Literally the worst ribs I have ever had in my life. Ruby Tuesday's ribs are 1000 times better than these. And that's saying a LOT.\n\nThe frickles (fried pickles) had a great crunchy coating, however the pickle itself was so mild and blah, it just tasted like fried cucumbers.\n\nThe cornbread was also very dry and kind of tough. The sweet butter made it tolerable though. There might have been some honey in that.\n\nThere was some painted \"rules\" or whatever on the wall describing the laws they abide by, such as: not boiling their meat as it removes flavor, not using charcoal because it has petroleum, etc. The number one rule is that they always keep their beer ice cold for you. That was the most ironic thing. Our beer from the tap was literally room temperature. Speaking of temperature. I read another review about this place that it was 85 degrees in there. I figured it was an isolated incident and maybe the A/C broke that day. Nope. It was so effing hot in there. I was sweating the entire time.\n\nThe prices are cheap, but that's about it for the good things. Their tagline is \"the only 1 star restaurant in Providence\". I love how they're trying to be ironic and funny about it, but that's literally what I am rating this place. I normally give every restaurant 3 chances before I write them off. (cook or waitress could have an off/bad day or whatever). But nothing was even good here. Not the entree, not the sides, not the drinks. It's just not worth it to even give it a second shot.",

Wise decision.\nThe interior is neat and clean, and it was not packed. A polite waiter guided us to a table. This place has more varieties on naan compared to other Indian restaurants I been to. Ordered the Curried Mussels for appetizers, one Cheese Naan, one Onion Kulcha(also naan), one plate of rice, Lamb Madras, and Chicken Korma.\nThe mussels were covered in curry sauce, and the sauce itself was very flavorful. The mussels were okay, nothing special, nothing bad.  The Naans were soft and hot, like Chinese Onion Bread (). The Lamb Madras is lamb cooked in coconut sauce. It was okay. The Chicken Korma is boneless chicken in a special sauce with cream & nuts. It was really good. I guess my favorite part of Indian cuisine is dipping naans into different sauces, and this place provides decent sauces for me to dip stuff in, so I'm happy. Fills you up really fast too. The gf couldn't finish her portion of the food, so we boxed it and it becomes her meal for the next day.\nI am not an expert on how Indian cuisine should be like, but being one of the two Indian restaurants in SLO, I think this place is doing alright. The waiter was quite impatient though, coming back over and over and asking what we want to order while we just sat down for less than 5 minutes. Then he went to the kitchen and ignored us for a bit when we are done deciding. I would be more okay with this if the place is really busy, but that was not that the case. The restaurant only had two more tables to take care of at that time and their service was not as good as it should be. The time it takes food to get to the table is also quite long for some reason. Also if you pay with a card they give you a gift receipt, not an official receipt, and you have to ask them for it. They would make a copy of the merchant's copy receipt for you. It is nice to be conservative and save paper, but if you are running a restaurant business, I think a receipt for the customer should be provided, not some gift receipt that looked like some random paper.\nI honestly don't know whether I will come back here in the future. I do think I should give Shalimar a try before making the final decision though.",

                    "text": "I admit (with shame) that I delayed eating at Doodles until just recently.  The location is set in the greasy pit of campus-town, where I hesitate to venture unless compelled to by some supernatural force (like the lure of hot noodles in winter).\n\nThe interior space of this tiny shop is not exactly comfortable, but this is the unfortunate case with most campus businesses (i.e., furniture and surfaces should be able to withstand physical punishment from college students).  For those choosing to dine inside, there's a picnic-style bench and a counter with stools.  I guess I can't hold the lack of interior design against them because the restaurant is not attempting to follow a conventional theme.  \n\nThe manager explained the primary concept behind the place is \"food-to-go\" (so students can eat something while running around campus), and all the food is packaged for such a purpose, including the noodles.  Next to the front counter is a cooler with various drinks (both American sodas and Asian fruit juices) and \"snack\" foods.  From what I observed, the same snack foods aren't served each day, though I haven't gone often enough to figure out the pattern/rotation of the different foods.  These were a few dishes I noticed during my visits: glutinous rice balls (classic snack served in Taiwan and other parts of China), Chinese steamed buns, edamame, various sushi rolls, vegetarian gyoza, and spam musubi (a Japanese-Hawaiian invention that probably deserves a certain skepticism from most diners). \n\nOf course, the main feature of this shop is ramen.  When I mention this, most people respond indignantly, \"What!?  You can buy ramen for 40 cents at Wal-Mart!\"  The ramen-eating experience here is NOT the same as boiling noodles and adding sauce packets in your own home, though.  Your ramen bowl is fully customizable, from the available broths (sesame, miso, kimchi, beef, seafood, etc.) to the toppings you can request for your bowl (baby bok choy, nappa, egg, fried tofu, wakame, Thai fish cakes, beef meatballs, etc.).  At around 50 cents per topping, I was initially expecting pretty skim offerings, but I actually get a pretty decent ratio of noodles to vegetables.\n\nMaybe this little restaurant appeals to me because very few places can offer me a reasonable lunch for $3 (and student debts are the primary constraint on my dining options).  Probably real adults with real jobs would be less impressed by Doodles, but this is an ideal restaurant for most college students.",

The decor is beautiful (in particular, I compared it with the Hyatt Santa Clara, where i also stayed recently, and which has much more dated decor), and their Heavenly beds are, yes, heavenly.  I normally hate hotel beds, but I slept like a baby at the Westin (though that could've been due to the copious number of gin and tonics I had at the wedding reception).  The rooms are sizeable, and the bathrooms are *amazing*.  The shower has dual heads, and the bathtub is detached, like some sort of class-ay master bath or what have you.  My only complaint (and reason for the one star deduction) was that it took about 10 minutes for the water in the shower to warm up to a suitable temperature.  However, my friends who stayed in a different room had no problem with their shower, so it was probably just the pipes in my room.\n\nThe pool area, as others have mentioned, is quite small, so don't expect to get your lap swimming in.  I didn't go for a dip, but my friends did enjoy the hot tub.  We also liked the nearby bar/lounge area, where we spent a significant amount of time lying around on couches and chatting.\n\nThe location of the hotel is prime -- just a few minutes walk from the Caltrain, downtown Palo Alto, and a huge upscale mall.  It was super easy to grab some local eats -- and for my friend to buy slacks when he realized that he forgot to bring his suit!  (The mall was so close that he managed to run there, buy pants, and make it to the wedding ceremony before anyone else showed up.)\n\nRunners will be happy to know that Westin has teamed up with Runner's World to provide a map of trails around some of their hotel locations.  The front desk gave me a small playing card-sized map of 3-mile and 5-mile trails circling Stanford University, which I happily used for my Saturday morning long run.  I had a great run and a great weekend, and I'd definitely stay here the next time I have reason to be in the peninsula area.",

If you need somewhere to go for a special occasion, this is a good bet. It wasn't difficult to get a reservation even on Valentine's day. Note: Flemmings gives you a $25 gift card for coming on V-day. \n\nFill up on free bread because the entrees are pricey and everything comes Ala Carte. Meaning, that if you want the steak you have to pay $30 and then another $10 for mashed potatoes. Expect to spend some cash at a nice restaurant like this, but you don't need to break the bank. \n\nI would recommend going on Sunday and getting the Prime Rib Dinner for $36 because you get the Prime Rib, a salad, a side and a desert. That' a $60 value based on their prices. If you are trying to save some money another option is getting something off the \"petite\" part of the menu. I ordered the Petite Fillet Mignon and it was only $29 and it came with potatoes. That with the free bread (with yummy butter spreads) will get you full. \n\nI also hear that this place has a great happy hour between 5-7pm where you get fancy cocktails and appetizers for $5 or $6 each. In addition, Flemmings has a unique romantic atmosphere. I liked sitting in the wine room. Being surrounded by wine photos and nice wine bottles made me want to order wine with dinner, but I didn't because I'm cheap :). \n\nI'd give this place 5 stars, but everything was a little too buttery for me.  The restaurant cooks everything with butter.  The potatoes, the steak, the veggies and especially the creamed spinach.    \n\nIf you're feeling like steak and you have some cash burning a hole in your pocket, go to Flemmings.\n\nP.S. The chocolate lave cake is worth the $10 you gotta reluctantly shell out when the waiter pitches it at the end of the meal.",

                    "text": "This Best Buy is terrible.  I base this claim off of several observations.\n\n1. They never answer the phone.  I don't know if this is standard Best Buy policy, but if you should ever want to know if they have the item you are looking for, you're going to have to suck it up and head on in, because they aren't going to pick up the phone.  I presume this is because the answer to any question of the form \"Do you have xxxx in stock?\" is \"No.\"  This brings me to my second point.\n\n2. Their selection is mediocre at best.  Keep in mind, it's still a Best Buy, so they have a good deal of inventory, but as Best Buy's go it's not that big, and I would say at least 40% of the time they don't have the thing I am looking for.  Granted, during the holidays there were some hot commodities that would have been hard to come by regularly, but even prologue to that I had trouble finding what I wanted.\n\n3. People like to camp in the bathrooms.  No, wait, hear me out on this.  The men's bathroom has two stalls.  The one time I felt nature calling while in this Best Buy, I stepped into the men's room to find both stalls occupied.  Fine; I love the waiting game just as much as the next guy.  Except for the fact that one guy is clearly reading the newspaper, as evidenced by the ruffling of the pages, and the other guy stays on the pot for upwards of 15 minutes, only to finally stand up and retrieve his shirt from the ground, put it back on, and exit the stall.  Yes indeed, dude took of his shirt to take care of his business.  I don't know how long that other guy was reading the newspaper, I left the room well before him to try my luck at another establishment.  He must be the guy they get to answer their phones.\n\nIn summary, the term Best Buy truly is an inapt description of this retail store.  It would be far less misleading for the consumer if its name was changed to \"Mediocre Buy,\" \"Decent Buy if you can actually find what you want,\" or perhaps \"An Ok Buy (Although you could certainly do better) provided you've gone to the bathroom before leaving the house.\"",

                    "text": "I was shopping in the Village on a cold and blustery day, and as I walked from store to store, I was gradually lured like Toucan Sam by the smell of fresh herbs and spices wafting from what I discovered was Miss Saigon Cafe, a small (about 10 tables) though smartly appointed little restaurant. I thought a steaming bowl of Pho would be just the ticket, but unfortunately, no dice that day. Not to be discouraged, I thought I'd go for one of my favorites, the Bun Thit Nuong. The menu however was completely in English - not that I speak Vietnamese or anything - but it kinda threw me off since I'm used to looking for a section of Bun dishes, or scanning for the delicious Thit Nuong, and without the Vietnamese alongside the English, you might be ordering something slightly different. Seeing a vermicelli section listed with pork, chicken, beef, and several other options, I figured that was what I was after, and ordered a combination  of pork and egg roll for $12. While the pork was savory, it wasn't particularly warm, and the noodles were actually quite cold. The egg roll was piping hot, and allowed me to make some warmer bites. The vegetables were very fresh, including lettuce, sprouts, cucumber, carrots, and mint. You don't get mint at a lot of places, and I found it gave a delightfully pungent aroma to the dish. Along with the fish sauce on the side, it all tasted good, I just wish it had come out a bit warmer on a cold day.\n\nA bit tired, and fond of Vietnamese coffee, I ordered a glass (why iced coffee on a cold day? I don't know.) It came out in a small glass mug as the coffee dripped into the condensed milk at the bottom. I poured it over the accompanying glass of ice, and while good, it wasn't $4.50 good. In the end, I left with a nearly $20 tab (tax incl.), and though it was good, it wasn't quite the weekday lunch I might have gotten elsewhere for the price. I'll probably continue to patronize Miss Saigon when I'm in the village, just hopefully on a Pho day.",

                    "text": "Sooo very glad to find a great pizza spot closer to home than San Francisco.\n\nI read about the opening of Howie's a few weeks ago and finally had the chance to plan a trip there tonight. I looked forward to it and talked it up to the hubby for two days straight; the reviews and pictures had me hoping for an excellent pie a la Gialina, our previous favorite.\n\nAt 5:45 the place was already busy with young families and couples. We could have waited for a table, but we sat at the bar right away. All the better, we love sitting at the bar.\n\nWe ordered two glasses of wine, very pleased with both. Howie's knows how to provide good and inexpensive red wine to pair with pizza. Even the house red- \"Howie's Red\"- was really good. We shared a Caesar salad to start. The romaine was crisp and fresh, the dressing lightly coated the leaves without drenching. \n\nBut oh, the pizza. Please note, the online menu does not reflect the reality exactly. We tried two of the offerings on the menu, split on one pie: the house-made sausage with broccoli rabe, and the pizza bianco. It came piping hot on an elevated trivet, and we dug right in.\n\nThe crust is so good. It's funny how pizza crust can make or break, as it should be so fantastic but not overpower the toppings. Broccoli rabe is a wonderful topping for pizza, and the pizza bianco had such wonderful flavor from the plethora of cheeses. If I remember correctly, it was topped with mozzarella, parmesan, smoked mozzarella, and housemade ricotta. I may be omitting one or two. It was also topped with fresh chopped scallions, and with a little added red pepper flakes it was divine. We didn't leave any behind.\n\nI am so happy to say that we will be back again and again... very soon. Palo Alto is a much easier drive from San Mateo than Glen Park, and I can't wait to try some of Howie's other pies. We'll be back at the bar to sample other pies soon.",

The staff is friendly, and they even explain all of the dishes to you and how to eat them, so fear not if you've never had Ethiopian before. The waiters also bring around hot towels at the beginning and end so you can clean your hands before you eat . . . and after since you eat the meal with your hands. Regular utensils are available too for those of you who don't care to get down and dirty. Personally, I think eating with your hands makes the food taste much better.\n\nWhen you walk in, you can opt for conventional table seating, or the more traditional basket table seating. I think if you are going in a large group and sharing the buffet, the regular table seating may be easier to work with. However, the basket table is a pretty fun experience.\n\nWhenever I come here, I always order the same thing: the meat buffet. I love that there are so many dishes that come with it, and they are all you can eat. Don't let your eyes deceive you--it may not look like much, i.e. little mounds of food on a tray, but typically one or two refills of a few dishes will be enough to leave me happily full and satisfied.  The buffet is great in that you get to try a little bit of everything.\n\nMy favorite of the buffet dishes are the lamb and the mixed vegetables. I can't get enough of them. I also love the soft, white bread--happy, heavenly, starchy goodness.  \n\nI haven't tried any of the desserts here, but I have to admit, they all look really delicious. The problem is, I usually fill up with too much buffet and don't leave enough room for the after party. Either way, it's a win-win situation, and one happy student walks out of this place for the night.",

I had lunch here earlier today, and was so excited to see a menu of sandwiches and salads that didn't contain french fries....\n\nThe atmosphere is minimalist.  There are some bright colors, but it's mostly just cafeteria-style tables and chairs, no decoration.  You order at the counter, then wait awhile - about 15 minutes in our case - for your lunch.  My boyfriend got the meatloaf melt, and I ordered the grilled chicken pesto sandwich.  It was hard to wait so long, but as soon as we got our sandwiches it was obvious why we had been left hanging - the food was FRESH.  My sandwich was hot, the chicken fresh off the grill, the tomatoes sweet and flavorful, the pesto made in-house (you can see the rustic bits of pine nuts and basil, definitely not the jarred stuff), the ciabatta roll lightly toasted and crispy.  I was really impressed from the first bite.  There's nothing really unique about the sandwich, except that it is made with high-quality ingredients and hasn't been sitting in a case all day, but that made a huge difference!  I tried my boyfriend's meatloaf sandwich, which wasn't as big as I thought it would be, and I liked it okay...the sauce was pretty sweet.  I preferred mine - it tasted so garden fresh.\n\nFor dessert we had a black bean brownie - yes, really - and it was great!  Who knew?  It just tastes like a creamy, chocolatey brownie.  You can put black beans in dessert!?  This changes everything.  Definitely craveworthy.\n\nThe only thing I'm not crazy about is the ambiance.  Since you have to wait so long, it'd be nice if the dining area was more comfortable or better maintained.  There was lots of water on the floor and I almost slipped a few times, we had to wipe down our own table....not a huge deal, but we noticed.  There are lots of big, sunny windows, so that's a plus.  I was also disappointed in the small Styrofoam cups for water - I hate drinking out of Styrofoam, it feels so wasteful (and the cups are so small you have to go back a million times to refill).  But I'd definitely come back - maybe for takeout next time - if I was very tasty and unlike anything else you can get in the area.",

CCB is a true gem.  \n\nMy friend and I spent the night in SLO during a trip to Hearst's castle. We created our own pub crawl and started at Central Coast because it was the closest bar to our hotel. Thus my head was still clear when I left CCB and this review is remarkably accurate.  \n\nWhat a find!\n\nThis is not a restaurant, there's no good food to order.  They do happen to have some really tasty snacks from Louisiana, but the showcases here are the beer, the ambiance and the beer.  Not into beer?  skip it, head downtown. \n\nCentral Coast has just made a major upgrade to their production capabilities.  When you taste their beer you know why they are in demand.  They make a variety of beers and ales so there is something for any beer lover.  They serve you in tasting glasses equivalent to 1/3 of a pint.  But each taste is only $1 or $2, so you end up drinking a fresh, deliciously crafted pint for $3-6.  Quite a deal for a pint of anything, let alone something the quality CCB is churning out.  \n\nThe staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Since the bartender is one of the 3 guys who actually makes the beer, he can basically tell you anything you'd want to know about the beer or the process by which it is made.  The bar (which has about 6 seats) is literally sitting in the middle of the industrial tubs they use to make the beer.  You are drinking smack in the middle of the brewery itself. Pretty neat.\n\nLooking for a high class place with hors de vours?  Not for you.\nLooking to impress your date with your worldliness?  The box of board games beside the bar will hurt your chances.\n\nLooking for a casual, laid back atmosphere where you can get the treat of delicious beer?  This is your spot. Drew, the bartender handed us the tv remote without us even asking.  The owner came over and told us the origins of India Pale Ale.  I sampled (not shot glass tastes, real samples) 5 beers for $8 and found 3 that I loved. We sampled the hot nuts- damn tasty, got our lips a burnin. \n\nOh, and my traveling companion found the perfect gift for her brother in law to be- a growler of their Winter Ale. \n\nGO HERE!  You will not regret it.",

                    "text": "So going in, I'd heard a lot of good things, but was a little concerned about getting small portions at a high price. This is...kinda true.\n\nWe started off on the wrong foot with this place. Got seated at the chef's table or whatever they chose to call it - basically a bar in front of the kitchen sans alcohol, so a n up-close view of the kitchen. \n\nWhat's wrong with this, you might ask? Well, the servers promptly forgot about us, which is admittedly easy to do given that it's a bit of an awkward corner.\n\nAfter 10 minutes or so of waiting, my friend was getting a little impatient given we hadn't even gotten waters yet, so I flagged down a member of the waitstaff and asked if we could get a server. She promptly apologized and our water carafe appeared momentarily.\n\nThen, in an excellent move, a manager or supervisor deftly entered the scene and offered to comp us drinks or an antipasti as an apology. Well played, my friend.\n\nWe got the crispy pork belly that we'd been eyeing and didn't regret it. Rich, decadent, and extremely flavorful. Excellent item, if not for what would have been a rather steep price for the portion. It's about the width of a smartphone and a shade under 1.5x its length, maybe 2.5\" tall. Would be more fairly priced at $6-7, but $10 is a bit much.\n\nNext we got the Wild Mushroom & Ham pizza. Came out piping hot, bubbly, slightly charred at spots - how I expect a pizza at a nicer place to come out. It was solid overall, with the mushrooms lending a mild earthy flavor. Could've used a pinch more cheese, and I felt like the prosciutto didn't come out strongly, being covered up by the mushrooms, the tang of the sauce, and a pleasant sweetness from the dough. All in all, hard to say it was anything but a pretty great pizza. Definitely worth the $15 if you want a quality pie.\n\nAfter our initial waiting incident, all the waitstaff were especially courteous and very attentive with everything so service was in a word, excellent.\n\nThanks to a great save, this was a strong first visit. Would definitely come again.",

I had low expectations and reminded myself that just one encounter does not mean I have to make a serious long term commitment. \n\nMy low expectations were met and in a way, it made me a little wistful. The people at The Maharaja, like so many of my Match.com dates, were so sincere, so well-meaning and so determined to please that it is hard to tromp on their eager spirits and say, \"Well, I just did not feel that connection, you know?\"\n\nLike some of my old Match.com dates, The Maharaja has an unusual, rather garish style and needs to pay attention to some pertinent cleanliness issues. The over the top gold, maroon and carved wood decor clashes sharply with the somewhat picturesque view if you are able to snag a window seat. The style is just not the kind I am used to with my conservative upbringing and my aversion to gaudy accessories. Seats are uncomfortable and the tables are glass covered with a large gap underneath the glass that reveals many ancient rice grains and other rotting unmentionables. \n\nLike some of my Match.com dates, The Maharaja seems to offer a lot outwardly, but the quality was just not what I was hoping for. The food, like some of my dates, was not hot enough and was way too greasy for me. Oil was radiating out of my Baingan Bharta, which was tragically lacking flavor and spice. I paid extra for mango chutney which was served as a glop of congealed yellowness and was just as unappetizing as it appeared. \n\nEven though I had a coupon that gave me a discount, I was pretty surprised when the bill arrived. Like some of my Match.com dates, my dalliance with The Maharaja proved to be surprisingly more costly than I had expected.  \n\nThey were very, very kind and they really meant well, but like some of my long ago dates, the wild and crazy bling-bling style, the lack of spice and those important cleanliness issues just did not click with me. Hopefully you'll have better luck.",

                    "text": "I lived in a city full of restaurants and good eats (Houston), and my review of this place is not as severe as others.  I think the place is generally trying to make a good impression- a modern stove, exposed stone wall, contemporary seating.  I would not call it \"cuban\" or even \"latino\" per se, except it has a creative menu for mixed drinks. I had the \"desert healer\" because I am fan of gin, which is quite refreshing.  The chips/peach salsa sample was excellent to go with the type of drinks it served.  My friend and I shared the pressed watermelon salad, it has the right blend of sea salt, arugula, fluffed goat cheese to counteract the sweetness of the fruit, the combination is thoughtful and not overdone.  For main entree I had the corvina, in my opinion, is one of the better fish dish I have had in a long time. It is perfected seared with the right amount of spice, served over a savory serving of rice.  To top it off, I had the vanilla leche (which was a bit too hot off the frying pan) but otherwise a well rounded compliment to my dinner.  The quality of the food is good. I do not understand people who complain about the price- you are paying for creativity, ingredients and human labor, and why should things be cheap?!!  It is a bargain compare to restaurant this standard in Europe.  \n\nSeveral suggestions I have for the place- the seats opposite the booth on the left (of front door) are too low, it is awkward when you are facing people trying to have a conversation.  The music should be several decibel lower.  The general feeling of the place is too airy, too open, which is why normal conversation volume is strained.  The entree menu needs a bit more diversity from the rest of the main street venues, the restaurant needs its own niche, not \"just like the other down the road\" feel.  Pick one thing and do it REALLY well.  Even contempo mix can be bland after repetitions.  \n\nOverall, I would say, as someone who has a picky palate, the restaurant has potential and has room for improvement.  I would like to see it grow in its own personality and strength.",

After reading countless reviews on Yelp, I decided to make an appointment here. I had already been here before, but for a full body massage.\n\nThere isn't much parking in the back or on the street but we were greeted in a friendly manner as we entered the spa. The young Chinese guy confirmed our reservation and then asked for us to pay for our services ahead of time. I told him we wanted to pay afterwards and he was fine with that. They make you fill out a sheet of paper with information, including an indication of where your pains are located.\n\nThis time I decided to try the $20 head to toe massage, where you are sitting in a chair with your feet in a bucket of soothing hot water, and you are being massaged fully clothed, from head to toe. For $20 you can't beat the price. They massage your head, neck, back, arms, legs, and feet all in one hour. The woman who was working on me was great, and pretty strong. She got to all the spots I had indicated on my sheet, such as my neck, shoulders, and upper back. She actually digged in, as I specified I wanted hard pressure.\n\nThe facial I received was awesome, and probably one of the best I've had, not to mention it was only $40. Aida did a great job on the facial, even including a face and head massage as I laid there. \n\nMy future mother-in-law came out raving about the place, saying that was probably the best facial she ever received (and she has had many facials). I will definitely return again for the $20 head-to-toe massage and the $40 facial. We tipped the women well for their excellent service. I'm returning in a few weeks to get the deep deep cleansing facial just before my wedding.",

                    "text": "It's important to have understanding friends who are unfazed by whatever you may ask them.  For example, when you happen to throw out something like: \"Hey, do you want to have a pancake breakfast at 8 am next Monday?\" you want someone to say \"Sure.\"  No judgments, no eye-rolling.  Just understanding and helpful suggestions - what more can you ask for?\n\nThat's how we ended at Kitchenette Uptown (not to be confused with this place, Kitchenette SF: http://www.yelp.com/biz/kitchenette-san-francisco#hrid:nUOY87bnI1ZJDU47n86nFQ).  It was my first time at Kitchenette since oh, about 5 years ago, so it felt new and exciting.  Actually, it felt kind of old and exciting, because that's the theme here.  It's easy to forget you're in New York City when you're dining at Kitchenette.  It feels as though you are transported to a small diner in the country (unlike a Cracker Barrel decor, this one feels more authentic).  The rustic and rusty sunflowers on the walls, along with simple white paint, make you feel comfy and homey.  The tabletops are made of old doors painted in soft pastel colors.  Ours were chartreuse and powder blue.  Ahhh, serenity now.\n\nThe food, fittingly, is simple comfort food.  I had scrambled eggs with  bacon, grits and multigrain toast.  Everything was above average, but not spectacular.  It's eggs and bacon, how original can they be?  I was pleasantly surprised by the grits, which were freshly made and tasted better than one would expect grits to taste north of the Mason-Dixon line.\n\nThere were only 3 other parties at the restaurant this early in the morning, and the waiter was on top of it.  He kept refiling our Mason jars with water, and kept offering us more coffee.  Eventually, we had no choice but to refuse his \"advances\" and continued our conversation sans coffee.  Finally, he brought us the check on a yellow tin tray: whaddya know?  more sunflowers.  2 big combo breakfasts + 2 coffees + tax = $27.  How can you beat that?\n\nBonus points for a great value.  Bonus points for serving coffee in big mugs, the way it's supposed to be.  More bonus points for air conditioning, as it was promising to be another hot day in New York City.\n\n***3.5 stars, rounded down***",

A break in the day allowed for an early dinner/snack, and what better time to have my first experience.\n\nUpon entering, the lack of any real pizzazz hits home hard. Yellow painted walls with only an open letter from the owner closest to the door, and a weak outline of the Chicago skyline are the only d\u00e9cor of ChiDogO's. With such a rich history, it should be a no-brainer to really pay tribute to one of America's great cities. The owner is a native Chicagoan, but doesn't provide any evidence of that, which is very disappointing.\n\nYou can hear the fry basket drop as well, as there is no music pumped in. This is an even greater travesty than the bare walls. Where are the sounds of Chicago bluesmen like  Buddy Guy, Howling Wolf, and Willie Dixon? Hell, even \"My Kind of Town\" by Frankie on repeat would at least be something.\n\nThe theme of the fast-casual eatery is Chicago style hot dogs, and Chicago Italian Beef Sandwiches. An Italian Beef Sandwich had been something I had been craving. A reasonable $ 0.50 add-on charge for Mozzarella and peppers is in place, but the sandwich would be naked without them. The size of the sandwich paired with the prize is reasonable. The trouble I had with it is that the meat tasted and looked like Arby's roast beef, and is more than likely purchased prepared and pre-seasoned, and not roasted in house. The size of the kitchen was more than adequate to roast several tip roasts. The bread and Au Jus were perfect however, and the fresh crispness of the Giardinera mix was right on point.\n\nThe fries were not fresh-cut, but were thick, crisp, and made for great clean-up of the left over Au Jus from the sandwich.\n\nThe service was very by the book, but solid. After I had sat down, the employee stated very sternly to a patron that a combo deal could not allow for a Chili-Cheese fry modification, as the system would not allow it. It's never good to see uneducated (about their product, not in general) robots in the food and hospitality arena, but such is life  It was a one-man show on a Wednesday afternoon, but the order preparation was fairly quick. \n\nI will return, but with a lesser amount of enthusiasm. It would be a pleasant surprise if the ownership group embraces the spirit of Chicago more though.",

The waitress was attentive and fast, without being obtrusive. I started with the Tongue as a snack, most of you probably aren't interested in tongue but it was very good. Next I had the catfish.  I don't like catfish but the southerner I was with recommended I try it.  There was a crust on the fish which was perfect and added just the right amount of texture and spice.  I don't like catfish because of the muddy taste that it can have.  This fish had minimal but an occasional touch of the muddy flavor, but it worked.  It worked because of the Cajun style sauce that came with the dish, which was spicy but not hot, so that it really was very well balanced.  Collard greens and rice accompanied the dish as well. The collard greens were the best I have ever had, but then again my experience with collard greens is limited to the northeast.  The rice was excellent.  Then came the grits, which had fatty ham and cheese added, again excellent. Finally I was persuaded to try the chocolate cake, which was by far the best and most moist chocolate I ever had.  When I say moist its hard to describe but I guess I should say light and in no way like any cake I have ever tasted.  I met the owner, a surprisingly thin man for such an excellent restaurateur.  He was gracious, modest, and seemed somewhat surprised at my compliments. Please try this great restaurant and let me know if you rate it anything less the five stars.",

                    "text": "So I waited for National Popcorn Day to review this popcorn joint.  Actually, I had no idea that today was that day mentioned, until I looked up the Cornucopia listing on Yelp.  That means free popcorn!  Hooray for special offer listings.  \n\nPros\n*The 2 owners were juggling a full house.  At least 3-4 groups were inside, all wanting to sample flavors and ask questions.  The girls remained sweet and kind the whole time.  I was shocked to be greeted as I was standing at the back on the line waiting.  That was nice.  Hello to you too!!\n*Samples galore!  I like to have samples pushed on me.  Otherwise I tend to stick with what I know and not branch out.  Even after I placed my popcorn order I was offered samples of other flavors.\n*Free popcorn!\n*The board with the selections were very easy to read.  Even though I had been here before the changeover, I felt I could easily figure out the popcorn game plan.\n*Popcorn scented candles.  Yep.  Hot buttered popcorn burning in your house?  Hmmm, I'll hold off on that one.\n*No-powder flavors.  Unlike my other popcorn visit to a store down south, the popcorn did not taste like it was dipped in powder.  The flavors clung quite nicely to the corn.  No junk under my fingernails.\n*Popcorn rewards card.  Buy 6, get the next medium bag free.  Cool\n\nCons\n*Price is a little bit high.  I knew this coming in, and I was fine with it.  It did stop me from buying a humongous bag of dill, and maybe that wasn't a bad thing after all.\n*One of the owners was telling our group if they had heard about Yelp and to give them a good review.  Most of them did not know was Yelp was, and I kept quiet to gauge the reaction of others.  I'm slightly torn by this.  Yes, my experience was awesome.  I plan to write a very good review.  But is it wrong to ask your customers to write reviews on their experience?  I don't know.  I felt it was an unusual request, but then again, I am slightly biased.  They were not offering an incentive for a review, but just getting their business out there.  \n\nRegardless of my wishy washy cons, I give these girlies 5 stars.  Congratulations on winning the \"popcorn wars\" in my book.",

Not bad flavour wise--the scallions helped--but the wontons were thick and chewy.  Jim got these.\n\nEgg roll: could have been better; a little bland\n\nThe chiles in oil---superb!  A lot of places have rancid or dead oil, but here it was fresh and hot!\n\nThen the giant plates of food.\n\n5-spice chicken: deep fried and tender, with a gooey sauce that wasn't too sweet--a bit tangy, but wow.  It was almost like a good barbeque sauce (yes, they actually do exist) instead of overly sweet to the point that you want to yak.  Very good, and I think I ate 1/3 of Jim's.\n\nSzechuwan beef: a generous amount tender strips with the typical melange of fresh veggies--Jim stole all of my broccoli, of which there was a lot--and the sauce was good and mild but not overpowering.  No MSG headache either.  \n\nIf we're going for dim sum, we will definitely head back to Shanghai Park, but for friendly service and a great no BS with tasty and fresh food, we'll head back to Hunan.\n\n$13 including tax for 2.  It's really a 3.5, but I felt like being generous\n\nEdit: I just browsed the other posts--somehow Princeton falls into the category of major cities in the world that should have a Chinatown?  LOL!  That's what you have Manhattan for sweetheart.  Or San Francisco, Paris, London...but Princeton?  That's cute.  We're in the suburbs.",

                    "text": "Just tried TKE for dinner with my friend tonight and my expectations were exceeded. I didn't really have any standard of quality for the food here but I enjoyed what I got. I will miss Maoz Vegetarian very deeply as I had many memories there but it's gone now.\n\nThe grand opening special is the $5 doner wrap (choose from chicken, lamb, beef, or veg). There is also a $7 doner plate special that includes some rice and a side salad. I ordered the combo doner plate (originally $7.50) that included chicken, lamb, and beef. Credit cards are accepted! The layout of the seating isn't the best but it's the exact furniture that Maoz used. Don't be fooled by the existing \"salad bar\" though as that is only for people who order the salad box and the variety is extremely limited. \n\nThe wait for the food was about 5 minutes and the guy who rang us up was remarkably nice and patient, and definitely not pushy. On a side note, I do always see him standing outside when I walk down Telegraph, most likely on a break since he wasn't offering any samples of falafels like Maoz used to do on a regular basis. \n\nThe plate was filled but not to the max. I did expect some more rice upon first glimpse. The pieces of chicken, lamb, and beef flattened the small scoop of rice. The salad was spread across about 1/3 of the plate and the leafy greens were pretty good with the vinaigrette and ranch dressings. I normally hate lamb because the texture of the meat isn't what my mouth is used to but I had a more favorable time eating it here as the slices were thinly cut. The chicken was average tasting, although I did add hot sauce to it to kick it up a notch in the flavor department. I didn't really notice the beef, or if I got any beef at all; lamb looks too much like beef. I am still full from the meal as I am typing this review so definitely give it a try but do not have extremely high expectations for a brand new place that is working its kinks out.",

I won't be buying anything fresh from here.  On a different note, you can get whole suckling pig for $170 and roasted ducks and chickens, but the mold thing will prevent me from getting anything not sealed (and as written earlier, even that doesn't mean anything).

Funny if she thought our table was seriously irritating....but we enjoyed talking with her well after our dinner was finished.  \n\nNow, on to the food.  Hmmmm.  Not so fabulous.  I have to agree with every other person that has mentioned the basil rolls.  SO PETITE.  Like really, really tiny.  Perfectly shaped, but that portion size was ridiculous. The basil rolls were also somewhat flavorless.  Definitely overwhelmed by the hoisin/sriracha paste that came with them.   I think the portions in general are small.  I didn't even get a to-go box tonight.  I am a piglet with a voracious appetite, yes, but usually I need a box when I leave my favorite Thai restaurant.  Not at Spoon.  \n\nWe also had the massaman curry with roti for an appetizer.  The curry was super thick and sweet, more like a caramelized peanut sauce with a splash of curry, and the roti was thicker and greasier than I would have liked, but still very good.  Don't get suckered into getting more roti for an additional 2 bucks though.  Just let the extra curry go to waste. \n\nOne of my friends got the basil fried rice (plus beef and chicken) and while he ranted and raved about how good it was, I thought it was just meh.  His serving was probably the best deal for the money though.  My other friend got massaman curry with chicken, and I thought it was okay.  Thank goodness it wasn't the same sauce that came with the appetizer, or else we'd all be home on an insulin drip right now. I got the basil stir fry with \"fish\" (I think it was catfish in the end)  and while it was good, it was still a little too sweet, and even though I asked for hot, the spice level was at best, very mild.  Another strange thing was the gummy soft rice that came with the meal.  So not a plus.   \n\nAll in all, the place has a nice feel, somewhat modern and raw, but still warm and casual.  Service, as mentioned, was great, they have lots of specials, and on Tuesdays, bottles of wine are half off.   I think this is a great addition to the neighborhood, and I loved the convenient parking and our fabulous waitress.",

Grabbed a couple seats at the bar by the fermenting machines, I'm a real beer nerd, so I was perfectly happy with the atmosphere.   I went with someone who could be considered a \"regular\" so he gave me a breakdown on the difference between their regular and seasonal brews, decided to start with a seasonal.  Tried the 15th Anniversay, great light brew, liked it so much that I ended up picking up a growler to go.  Pretty great deal for a micro brew, and for only $8.25 (first time you pay a deposit fee of a few bucks, after that it's the list price as long as you return the growler) couldn't pass up.  Also found out that they have these at Whole Foods, so you can still get great brew without having to travel to the bar every time you want it.\n\nFood was pretty good as well.  had the Muffuletta sandwich and fresh cut fries.  I have a lot of family from the NOLA area, so I tend to hold this sandwich to a pretty high standard, and they did a great job at meeting it.  Sandwich was hot, right mix of ingredients, and the fries were not oily.  The sandwich set me back $10, but worth every bite.  My buddy got the oyster po' boy, and said it was one of the best he'd had in a long time.\n\nWhy not 5 stars?   The service was pretty bad.  There was only one bartender, we had sat off to the side to avoid the crowded spaces at the bar, and he all but forgot about us for around 20 minutes.  While I appreciate his honesty about it, the place wasn't busy enough for it.  He did make up for it after that, and was very attentive.  \n\nAll in all, a great experience, and I look forward to going back to try their next round of seasonal beers (which were fermenting that day) and to check out the changes to the seasonal menu as well.",

                    "text": "First, a note - I've never been upstairs to the Soiree Room, which has a different menu and is more expensive, so this only applies to the downstairs Monday Club Bar, which is more casual, and which I love. My husband and I actually had our wedding reception there and it was perfect. The decor and ambience is fun, festive and memorable. All our guests commented that the food was the best they've ever had at a wedding - everything from the hot date appetizers to the spring pea soup to the entrees to the wedding cake (vanilla cake with lemon curd and cream cheese frosting). In particular, the hangar steak entree was ENORMOUS (almost too much!) and so tasty that my relatives still talk about it even though the wedding was over 2 years ago. The service was impeccable. During cocktail hour, the servers made sure to set aside a plate of appetizers for my husband and me, knowing that we'd be doing so much mingling that we'd forget to eat. When one of our guests broke a chair (by sitting on it - very embarrassing), they had another one under him before you even knew it. Another of my guests was a jazz singer and we asked her to perform a few songs during the early part of the evening. When she sat back down she started eating, but one of the servers noticed that her entree had gotten cold. He immediately went to the kitchen and brought her another one, without even being asked. All through the night the service was attentive and unobtrusive, right up to the clean-up, when they had all our candles and flower vases etc packed up for us and ready to go while we were still finishing up dancing.\nWe have gone back there several times and the food has always been very good, if not great (the steaks are always great), and the prices are reasonable (again, this is the downstairs room). I'm sad to read here that some people have had problems with the service, but we never have. This is a really unique and special place. If you are considering a wedding reception here, go for it.",

I felt bad as it seemed like they were probably understaffed but it's Sunday and you have brunch, aren't brunches usually busy?\n\nGather wasn't particularly packed and there were several open tables.  Upon walking in with a party of 3 we were told there would be a bit of a wait.\n\nUh.  Ok.  Maybe there were large parties coming in to take the open tables we saw all over the restaurant.\n\nOur hostess left, came back, offered us outdoor seating to which we were excited to say yes to, she left, came back and told us that the back patio was full and decided to sit us right near the host stand which was fine.\n\nWe sat and caught up.  We talked.  And we talked.  And we talked some more.  \n\n15 minutes water arrived after we raised our hand to request it.\n\nIt was a lazy Sunday with no real rush to go anywhere so it wasn't a huge deal but there just seemed to be this weird laissez-faire thing going on with our table.  We had to flag someone down to take our order.\n\nI like the space, the food was great and it made me want to come back for dinner and I'm hoping the service glitches were just because of the restaurant having an off day.\n\nI always appreciate restaurants that call out what is vegan and what can be veganized.  My braised mushroom sandwich was really nice, the greens on the side were perfectly dressed and my side of potato scallion hash was absolutely delicious.  I added the roasted market veggies (+$2.50) to my dish which I don't think I'd do again as it was a scoop of carrots and random white beans and it was COLD.  When I think of roasted veggies, I think of something hot with some charred bits which I love.  (I HEART CHAR!)\n\nI'll definitely come back for dinner and give Gather another shot but I hope the service is a bit more spot on next time.",

The night started off aright, we had to wait a while for someone to even speak to us but we didn't have reservations and were excited when they were able to seat us right.  it seemed a little out of control as the 2 hostess were running around looking for extra menus and had to swap out our dineLA menus on the fly.  My menu and the GF's menu were different but got confirmation from the waitress that the duck confit was NOT available.  \nFirst came the bread and water.  The bread was a simple loaf but it came out HOT and had this chive butter which was delicious.  We asked for more bread and butter and kilt it.  \nI got BLT soup(farmer's market soup), Rack of Lamb and  Roasted Pear and Frangipane Tart.  GF got Roasted Tomato and Eggplant Tart, NY Steak(?) they didn't have duck confit that night, and Pumpkin Blueberry Cake.  It all looked good on paper but what the heck Madeleine's?? The BLT soup was good, it seemed like they had yellow tomatoes, pureed it and added veggies and crispy bacon.  Delicious soup.  GF's tart was OK... it was this bready thing, i didn't care much for it.  To the mains... did the chef's salt glands malfunction or something?  I like to season and salt my food but OMG the meat, sauce and 'traditional ratatouille' were WAY over salted.  My salt glands were hurting by the end of the meal.  I finished it but what the damn.  The lamb was cooked as they said though, medium rare as lamb should be, it was tender but too salty.  It probably would not have been as bad if they had salty veggies and sauce and the meat was not.  The GF's was salty too, but not as crazy as mine.  The desserts... mine was good, reminded me of one of those Asian almond cookies but with pear.  GF's was interesting too, it was what it sounded like, just chewy for some reason.  \nOverall the experience was \"wth Madeleine's?' as i want at least the main course to impress me and they did not come to impress this night.  I do want to come back to try out their happy hour... half off  their Bistro menu(small plates).",

If you are looking for authentic Thai food similar to the kind you are used to in the Bay Area, you must try Thai Classic. Don't believe me? You can even catch a glimpse of Grandma cooking in the back during a hectic lunch rush.\n\nOk, on with the review...\n\nFood: As with any restaurant, you have to know what to order. Since I lived in San Luis Obispo for so many years, I was fortunate enough to try an assortment of things on the menu. First time here? This is what I'd recommend...\n\nGreen Curry with Chicken\nTom Yum Kai soup\nShrimp Salad\nPad-see Ew\nGarlic Pepper Beef\nSteamed Fish with Spicy Peppers\n\nService: Always friendly and smiling. Also, this place has the BEST water refill service I have ever experienced. I swear, no matter how spicy the food is or how much you are trying to rehydrate yourself after a long night \"downtown\" you will never see the bottom of your water glass. \n\nSpice Factor: They will always ask you how spicy you want your food....mild, medium, medium-spicy, or hot!!! I love spicy food and I would still tend to go for medium-spicy. All you daredevils be forewarned...grandma in the back will knock your socks off if you want off the charts spicy. Just make sure you have plenty of water and lime around to help the three-alarm fire in your mouth.\n\nPrice: I you go at lunch, you can have a complete meal with wonton soup, mini house salad, and an entree with rice for about $10 including tax. Not bad at all. Dinner is very reasonable as well and everything is served family style. \n\nLocation: Situated near the corner of Higuera and Santa Rosa, just behind Firestone's Grill, the location doesn't get any more convenient than this. \n\nAll in all, I highly recommend giving this place a try next time you are craving some great Thai food in SLO.",

                    "text": "Pretty bummed about my experience tonight.  Beautiful Friday evening in Cambridge with so much promise.  We heard good reviews.  We were disappointed....\n\nWhere to start?  We sat outside and thought we'd start with drinks and see where it took us.  I knew that cocktails were $11 so the price was expected but the cocktail that my fiancee ordered was underwhelming. (for an $11 cocktail)\n\nThe service was the worst part about it.  We actually had 2 servers as one was training...both were horrible.  I think the bar is too far away from the patio or the bartenders are VERY slow as everytime we bought a drink it seemed to take at least 10-15 minutes.  \n\nFor our second round, we both ordered a beer.  After 10 more minutes, our waitress(es) came and said that the \"taps were being reset and it was going to be another 15 minutes.... would you like a cocktail instead?\"   No thanks (not for $11)   So, we decided to wait for our beers.  Finally, the beers came and my girl's beer was WARM.  I worked in a bar before and they obviously served the beer in a recently dishwashed glass... major faux-paus.  Hot glass=warm beer.\n\nShe drank the beer for a little bit and was hesitant to say anything.  I eventually grabbed the never-there waitress and explained the situation... she said, \"would you like some ice cubes?\".  Are you kidding??\n\nReading this, you probably think that I write these nasty reviews all the time.  This is actually my first review ever.  I'm a pretty happy guy and have worked in the service industry for a while so I give people a break....not this place.\n\nOnly redeeming thing was the popcorn...\n\nWe left and went to Grendel's and had some fabulously cold beers at the bar, a few very cheap and delicious sandwiches and some great service and chat from the bartenders.\n\nIf you are going to charge that much Om, you better get things together.\n\nAs many have said here, lots of potential but management needs to step in and have some \"secret shoppers\" to get things right.",

So why were there so many elderly people hanging out in the lounge? Did I walk into the Oak Room, or a Country Club? No, It was a supposed to be a fun lounge.\n\nI dressed for fun, but I didn't wear any Prada. I don't like much Prada, and that made me look out of place. It looked like 90% of the people fell out of Louis, while I looked more \"First Call Sale\" @ Neiman's, and I think that had something to do with my long waits at the bar. Standing in front of a bartender's face for 20 minutes, is not what I call fun. Perhaps if I had DD ta-tas like some of the sluts that were pushing me out of the way and getting served in seconds, that wouldn't have been the case .... but I'm pretty sure most of the bar staff played for the other team, so I still don't get it.\n\nWhen I was able to get served, I had 4 different drinks. 2 of them were DISGUSTING, and I'm an alcoholic, so I shouldn't be saying such things.\n\nOut of the little food I tried, it was decent. There was nothing I couldn't get anywhere else for an arm and a leg  (or a Prada pump and Dior bag, rather.) . And I have a 3rd degree burn on my tongue from a spring roll. Maybe they could give out warnings about how hot they are inside, so I won't have to extinguish my mouth with one of those two DISGUSTING drinks. It's just a thought.\n\nMaybz I'd go back to impress a friend from New Hampshire, but certainly not a friend from NYC ... unless I want them to laugh at me for trying.\n\n\nI had more fun at Middlesex after I left. Much easier to get a drink, much better music, plenty of personal bathrooms to powder one's nose, but it's true ... unlike Om, there is NO waterfall. \n\n:(",

We booked the appointment weeks in advance. 1 hour before the appointment (after we already left the house) they called the house to cancel. Of course we never got the message and showed up at our appointment time. \n2. they decided to take us anyway, and said it would be a half hour wait. \n3. an HOUR after our appointment time, they took my sister (when I booked the appointments they said they could take us both at the same time so we wouldn't have to wait\n4. another HOUR after that, they took me. So I sat in a cramped waiting room with 3 seats, no magazines or reading materials, and no receptionist. \n5. dirty floors, dirty walls, and even more grotie--- DIRTY SHEETS- they did not change sheets between clients!!!\n6. The products they used for the facials were greasy, smelled bad, and did nothing to the skin. \n7. No towels in the bathrooms. just 1 cheap dinner table napkin to dry your hands. \n8. I waited --- all totaled-- three hours past my appointment time for a facial, then, had to wait another hour for my massage before I got sick of waiting and left without the massage. \n9  On a busy highway- you hear the sounds of POLICE SIRENS and HONKING HORNS the whole time\n10 They piped the SAME FOUR SONGS over the speakers the WHOLE TIME we were there. \n11 False Advertising. I copied the Spa Week Ad so you could see, that the special was for a facial AND a massage for $50. But it turned out they charged $50 for MY half hour facial, $50 for my sister's facial and another $50 for my sister's HALF HOUR massage- ... which was the worst massage my sister ever had. The therapist did not listen to my sister at all. So we paid $150 when it should have been $100. Here's the Spa Week Ad--- which states the Pebbles Green Spa Special includes a facial AND massage... a TOTAL LIE:\n\nSpa Week\u00ae $50 treatments - April 11-17, 2011\n\nPebbles Wellness\n8507 Baltimore Avenue\nCollege Park, MD 20772\n301.313.0322\nhttp://www.pebbleswell...\n     \n\nStep into Pebbles Wellness and enter a whole new world of quiet, peaceful solitude!

                    "text": "Environment:\nCausal and simple. Order at the cashier, they bring your food to your table. Bus the table yourself or leave the dishes there. The cashiers are always polite and repeat your order to make sure they get it right (they've never messed up an order!). The place is small; the salsa bar is the same counter as the cashier is the same counter as the soda bar. \n\nFood:\nI work right upstairs from El Metate and I am addicted to this place! I HAVE to go in at least once a week. Their lunch specials are always great: two tacos with beans and rice plus a large drink for $7.99, chile relleno and a tamale, two enchiladas, the list goes on...\n- Chicken tacos are awesome. The meat is dark meat, whole pieces, not like dry shredded meat some places servce. The seasoning is salty with a lil kick. On top is a generous heap of green leaf lettuce (no cheap iceberg!), tomatoes, and shredded cheese.\n- Guacamole is four stars. It's good in the sense that the consistency is good, the seasoning is good, onion to avo ratio is good, but where is the chile? No kick! I need a little life to my guac, or else it's just avo sauce. But let me tell you, there are plenty of days I only order the guac and chips for lunch. It's a lot - comes in a small styro container and only $2...which is unheard of!\n- Their burritos are okay. I can't speak to burritos much cuz I'm just not a fan of flour torts or the rice/bean/meat combo.\n- Enchiladas are great. Filled with a heap of meat or cheese, then gooey on top with more cheese and red sauce. Their tortilla always remains in tact and has that good chewy-ness to it - never soggy.\n- Chile rellenos are amazing. Their cheese is go tasty and perfectly melted. Which leads me to my next point...\n- Their food is always served at the correct temp. The meat is hot, lettuce is cold, and when served together in a taco, the flavor and temp combo of both is awesome.\n- Each table is served chips and salsa. Their salsa could be better - it's watery with mainly onions. I reco going to the salsa bar and using your own choice of dipping sauce.\n\nWhy four stars?\nLove the food, love the people. It's a great spot for a good lunch that won't take a long time, is fairly inexpensive, and is always prepared fresh to order. Try this place at least once and I'm sure you'll come back for more!",

                    "text": "Came to Grange with some friends late on a Thursday evening during Restaurant Week.  This was my first visit, and I had heard all about how Grange focuses on locally-sourced, sustainably-farmed foods.  I knew that Grange was also a fairly pricey restaurant, which is why I have never visited until now.\n\nWe were seated on the first floor at a small table and I noticed the dining area was quite small and cramped, but since it was relatively deserted that night (surprising to me since its Restaurant Week), it wasn't much of an issue.\n\nThe first course was a simple salad with vinaigrette dressing.  I was really underwhelmed by this.  The most I could taste was the pepper the waitress sprinkled on top of it.  It needed more dressing.  Overall just 'meh'.  For the main course I had chosen the whole-grain risotto.  This was actually my first time having risotto so I didn't know what to expect.  It came served with green beans, radishes, and I believe rhubarb.  While it was nice and hot when it got to our table, I found it to be extremely tasteless.  It really needed salt, which they don't leave for you on the table.  I was only able to force myself through half of it before my friend gave me half of her chicken breast (which was delicious) to eat.  The dessert course was a strawberry shortcake, which was alright I guess.  Nothing special, and the presentation was uninspired.\n\nOverall I was pretty disappointed with Grange.  In addition to the food falling flat, the service wasn't good.  After placing our drink orders we waited at least 20 minutes before receiving them and being able to order food.  Then, the waitress brought the main courses out while we were still finishing our salads!  I didn't think this meal was worth the $25 'reduced' rate, I can't even imagine how much the full price is.\n\nI thought Restaurant Week was a chance for (generally pricey) restaurants to lure in new customers by wowing them with what they can offer.  If that had happened I could have told all my friends and family how much I loved the food, and I probably would have gone back.  I wasn't wowed and now I've already told a bunch of people I know about my experience.  I'm disappointed you couldn't have put your best foot forward, Grange, because I really wanted to like you!",

Since I went to Emerson (as a grad student, not an undergrad), I knew I could wear duds from this store without anyone blinking an eye in the school hallways. Feather boas, bright colors, hats, and used boots? Hells yeah.\n\nThings have changed at this place in the last year or so. Seems like they're expanding on the HALLOWEEN market with tacky poop you could buy at Target for cheaper (no, I would NOT like a plastic pirate sword with that), but certain elements of GD never die. \n\nLike, for example, dollar-a-pound. You walked your ass all the way from the Kendall/ MIT T stop to be accosted by dust mites when you walk in the door? Yes you did. A large partitioned area of the downstairs black and white tile floor is covered in dirty-ass clothing that you can pile up and get for ONE DOLLA.' Digging for goods isn't really my scene, so I head upstairs where I can find new and used clothing at a decent price. Keep and eyeball out for rips and tears, even in the new clothing section (that stuff may look cool but it is not well made). Have a hot date? Buy some sexy stockings or fishnets. Doing a burlesque number? They've got your heels, fur coats, and vintage accessories right here. If you feel like dressing up like a fifties housewife, or a gay man in a house dress, check out the old-as-the-hills dresses for flourescent floral nightmares. My favorite local designer, Eddie Kent, makes pieces out of used clothing and sells them for a decent price. My coolest and strangest glittery, patchy, all-around gaudy skirts are Eddie Kent designs. Last I checked, he still does some of the mannequin displays, too.\n\nI have a beef with the blase and self-absorbed young peeps who work here, but I can overlook the crap service since the GD almost always has some item I want. Bring your wallet, your ass (no matter what size it is), and prepare to dive in. The Garment District will tear you up; it's the eye of the tiger.",

Today was the ideal day since it was freezing and raining out. I have been fighting off a cold for weeks and have become addicted to soups, so this was the perfect fit.\n\nThe location is right on Bancoft so be prepared to see a mixture of UCB students and tourists checking out all the great cafes, stores, boutiques, bookstores, etc.\n\nWe scored a great parking spot right our front and must of got there right before there lunch rush, because there was no line. As we gazed the menu and took in the mouth-watering smells...the sweet attentive staff asked if we wanted to sample anything...\n\nWe  immediately said Yes as we were so indecisive since there are soooo many soups to chose from. \n\n                               You name it- they got it!  \n\nThe sample size is pretty generous.. I could imagine starving students going ridiculous by sampling each soup and not needing to actually pay for anything. \n\nA staff member suggested  getting 2 kinds since we couldn't decide on one. So I got the Tortilla Soup and the Turkey Chilli! Each soup comes with a large piece of bread or a roll. \n\nAs you slide down to the cashier area there are also pre-made sandwiches, salads or you can customize a salad and beverages to chose from.  An assortment of condiments, napkins, to-go bags, and spoons of course.\n\nMoments later there was a line out the door. We were so excited that we were able to get here when we did!!\n\nThe woman who worked the cashier was as stale as day old bread. She lacked personality and really made our great experience questionable.\nI felt like she was the Soup Nazi, like the episode from Seinfeld.. she was very rude and not warm. \n\nThere isn't anywhere to sit and my co-worker knew this ahead of time, so we took our hot soups to go and headed back to the office.\n\nWhen we opened our bag of goodies... it was definitely worth the drive and the wait as we savored the warm flavorful hearty goodness!\n\nI loved each soup equally and can not wait to go back!\n\nBeware SF Soup Company, you are going to start seeing a lot of me!",

                    "text": "Oh Sprinkles, how you have spoiled me! Before this Sprinkles opened, I was already anticipating for its arrival months ahead, but I didn't venture in until two weeks it had opened because I just knew the lines would be ridiculous. But even after Sprinkles had been up and running for two weeks already, when my friends and I finally came here, we still had to wait more than an hour for our cupcakes! But boy, that wait was definitely worth it. \n\nI've returned to Sprinkles many times since then, especially when they have enticing limited flavors. I've had the:\n\nGERMAN CHOCOLATE: incredibly moist, amazing frosting/glace and some nice crunchy nuts to complement the soft texture of the cake.\nCHAI LATTE: it had a nice spice flavor, but it's not as good as I was expecting it to be.\nCHOCOLATE MARSHMALLOW: It doesn't look impressive, but it has a hidden surprise of marshmallow creme inside. The marshmallow goes SO WELL with the moist chocolate cake. \nMOCHA: This flavor was pretty decent, but not my favorite. The coffee taste to it was pretty strong, though!\nHOT RED VELVET: I believe this flavor is limited, but I didn't really care for it. It tasted like the Hot Tamales candy, which was weird and too spicy and overpowering.\nVANILLA: I've only had this when it was given away for free at UCSD events, which means they had been at least a day old. I can't really speak for how it tastes fresh, but I don't think I would spend $4 for just a vanilla cupcake anywhere.\nLEMON COCONUT: This flavor is very light and has the perfect lemon flavor that I find is often hard to achieve. This is a solid pick if you're looking for a medium between fancy and simple.\nRED VELVET: This is the best red velvet cupcake I've ever had. It was SO MOIST and the cream cheese frosting was thick, but not overpowering at all. \nSTRAWBERRY: My friend got this for me for a BOGO deal but I didn't have a chance to devour it until a day later, so it was not as moist. It's a unique flavor, but not the best.\nS'MORES (BY BLAKE LIVELY): YUM. This is one of the best cupcakes from Sprinkles, but too bad it was only for a limited time. The \"toasted\" marshmallow topping was so fluffy and yummy my friends and I could not help ourselves from digging in while we were waiting for the bus. There was a graham cracker cookie layer at the bottom that was a nice surprise.\nBROWN SUGAR PRALINE: Hands down THE BEST flavor I've had from Sprinkles thus far. The caramel cake was super moist and the frosting was to die for! I love brown sugar and the caramelized flavor really stood out. Too bad this is also a limited flavor, but I really hope I will be able to encounter this cupcake sometime again!\n\nI love Sprinkles, but be warned, it is a splurge. Each cupcake is $4 ! And even though the cupcake is actually quite filling, it's not something I can afford to treat myself to very frequently. I know it sounds like I've tried lots of flavors before, but it's because I take bites out of friends' cupcakes or I take advantage of BOGO offers or free cupcakes during Sprinkles' birthdays. I know they have free cupcake promotions on Facebook (ie., speak a certain \"word of the day\" to the employee or participate in their \"bring a sister/friend/etc\") for a certain number of participants. However, I always see their notifications too late or I'm not around the area. But seriously, if you can, get these cupcakes for a discounted price or for free!\n\nTL;DR: Brown Sugar Praline, Chocolate Marshmallow, German Chocolate, S'mores, and Red Velvet are the way to go if available. Get free cupcakes from FB promotions or special occasions, but prepare for a long wait!",

                    "text": "I really wanted to like Pod.. I really, really did. It was highly recommended by our server at Continental Mid-town and we were intrigued by it from several visits to Mad Mex next door. I knew that the Borgata's Chef Michael Shulson, who now owns Izakaya, used to work here and has quite the pedigree. The menu of Pan-Asian fusion cooking, of which I am usually a fan, looked delicious and intriguing. I had no idea that Pod had been around for more than ten years, as it looks brand new from the outside. Unfortunately for us, like Cirque du Soleil's 'Dralion' that we saw earlier that day, we left sorely disappointed. I'm getting ahead of myself here though.....\n\nI wasn't sure what to think of the ultra-modern, multi-colored, almost futuristic look of the bar and dining room. Quite honestly, while I was intrigued from afar, once inside I was kind of put off by the whole concept. Then, inexplicably, the place grew on me. It reminded me of a sophisticated, underground spaceship dining room.. chock full of odd, off kilter furniture and big party booths with buttons that allow the guests  to change the ambient lighting and smaller \"pod\" booths carved into the wall; not to mention a CONVEYOR BELT of endless sushi at the sushi bar! \n\nI think the same reasons I generally enjoy Stephen Starr's restaurants are the same ones for which other's don't.. the ultra-modern dining rooms, the young, boisterous crowds, the forward thinking cuisine.. I really 'get' it and just think some others do not.\n\nThat being said, the food here fell flat. Flat on it's face. This was one case where style certainly didn't equal substance. I honestly didn't remember what entr\u00e9e or appetizer I ordered and had to text my lovely girlfriend for a lot of the details of this review. We boxed up almost the entire Pad Thai to bring home with us and I felt utterly disappointed about the experience. \n\nBut let's back up a bit and discuss our meal. We entered and were seated immediately in the dining room at a table for two.. no wait. The restaurant was rather quiet, but it was a bitter cold night in late February. I recall them having some special 'mock' tails and we both really enjoyed our 'Vanilla & Ginger Soda' or whatever they were at the time. Unfortunately, at the time I am writing this review, they are apparently no longer on the menu.\n\nOur server was quite knowledgeable and made some recommendations as far as appetizers. We started off with the Crab Spring Rolls with sweet chili dipping sauce and Dim Sum Pork Dumplings with white soy dipping sauce. Both entrees were poorly executed and lacking in flavor, especially the Crab Spring Rolls. The only thing that made the Spring Rolls edible was the sweet chili dipping sauce. Yuck. The Dim Sum Pork Dumplings were only slightly better, and again, enhanced only by an overly salty dipping sauce.\n\nVery disappointed with our appetizers we pulled back on our ordering, whereas we normally would have splurged. We decided to share the Shrimp Pad Thai Noodles with red chili, peanuts, and mixed vegetables. The dish came out cool instead of piping hot, and the noodles were poorly and unevenly cooked. After only a few bites, I believe an overly aggressive busboy came to remove the plate and box up our entr\u00e9e. \n\nSpeaking of the busboys.. man alive! They are like vultures circling your table relentlessly asking if you're done with your dish, even when there is still food left on the plate! It happened to us not only with both appetizers, but with our entr\u00e9e as well! It made for a very uncomfortable and rushed meal.. one in which I am in no hurry to return to. I'd like to say I'd be a little more tolerant of this behavior if it was a Friday night and the place had a two-plus hour wait, but as it was, it was a freezing cold night in the middle of February and the place was nearly deserted! Let us enjoy our meal for crying out loud!\n\nThis is the first meal in a really, really long time that I was disappointed by. Disappointed may not even be a strong enough word, and two stars is REALLY stretching it. Service was good if super rushed, the 'mock' tails were tasty, and the d\u00e9cor grew on me, but overall.. the place was a definite \"eh\".\n\nThe menu looked SO good online, the sushi, the cocktails, the sea bass entr\u00e9e, the mandarin shrimp stir fry, crab fried rice, the Kobe steak appetizer cooked on a hot stone.. just a big letdown in my book. Okay, okay, so we didn't drink, I didn't do sushi, and we skipped the appetizer we really wanted because of it's size. We may have to revisit this place in the future to fairly judge it.. but it's going to be a long time before we make it back.",

                    "text": "For me, Small Word was THE coffee shop when I was too young to go the pub and the cool place to go and hang out before coffee shops were popular - well before the Starbucks craze.  Virtually everything about Small World, I love.  From the atmosphere, to the baristas, food, and coffee, Small World is THE quintessential college coffee shop that helps make Princeton, well, Princeton.  Without SWC, the town would certainly be missing some of that charm.\n\nWhen I was going there regularly, they were open later - which my friends and I loved.  I think they stayed open until 12:30am or 1am on the weekends and were open at least until 11pm during the weekday.  If they still had those hours, I'd probably go there more often when I'm in town visiting.\n\nMornings, of course, are where they are the most crowded and, as others have noted, it does have \"out the door\" lines sometimes.  I've never been bothered by the lines per se but on crowded nights, it could be hard to get a seat if you're in a group of 3 or more.  I've been going to SWC well before they opened up the food section on the left side which has soups and sandwiches - plus some breakfast items that aren't in the main case.  It's a welcome addition if not for the extra seating but certainly for the extra food stuffs they make available.\n\nI'm not a big fan of the live music they bring in, though.  Its not that the music is bad - far from it actually.  It's just louder than I like; for a small place, you don't need a lot of volume and I end up shouting at my friends to have a conversation.  When the bands aren't there, however, the noise level is a nice - perfect of having a conversation but still getting the sense that the place is bustling.\n\nI've always enjoyed Small World's coffee much more than Starbucks.  I've always thought Starbucks' coffee was too acidic for my taste and not smooth enough.  SWC's brew, in my opinion, is spot on; smooth, flavorful, just enough boldness, and without the acidic taste that poisons many of Starbucks' blends.  The tea selection is large and varied so if you're a pond jumper, you'll be happy, too.\n\nWhat made SWC special for me, were the flavored coffee drinks they whip up for you.  They were the first to offer me a mocha, mint mocha, hazelnut mocha, butterscotch mocha, and many other flavored lattes.  Their syrup selection is pretty large and it makes the experience new almost every time you order.\n\nHow you order and how they serve also unique.  If you get it go, you select your size (single or double) and they give you the customary paper cup.  But if you stay inside, they serve you in glassware - a nice touch that adds to that special something that makes them the coffee shop of Princeton.  One thing to note: you can ask for large cup of coffee and they'll call out something totally foreign to most.  Don't worry, chances are they know exactly what you want but apply their own name to it.\n\nOne special drink that I love - that doesn't exist anywhere else - are their double sticky ciders.  It's a large hot cider with a cinnamon stick added but because they use local cider (Terhune's I think), its fresh, thick, and just perfect.  No other place I've been to serves lit like they do.\n\nSmall World Coffee, as I've said, is THE coffee shop to visit in Princeton.  From their food, coffee, tea, and ciders, they have everything you want and nothing you don't.  I highly recommend them for all your caffeinated needs.",

                    "text": "I wish I could give half stars because this place is a pretty solid 3 and 1/2 stars. Not quite 4 stars for a couple of reasons, but definitely a little better than 3 stars.\n\nInside--very clean, cozy, cute. Good chinese food place to actually sit down and eat--it's a real restaurant.\n\nService--very nice, very attentive, and very polite. \n\nFood--All food was served piping hot and freshly made. Not sure if it was because my dad and I were the only people in there at the time, but whatever the reason--I'll take it. Started with some of the traditional soup chips, but it appears possibly more homemade because they were wider, smaller chips. Those were good, but the duck sauce was a little stale tasting, if you can imagine that.  Wanton soup was next and it was a light broth. The broth could have used more meat flavor to it, but the stuffed wanton noodles were very light and tasty. Next were egg rolls served delicately on a platter with duck sauce--very nice presentation--flavor was standard egg roll. They were a little greasy which was my only real complaint. Other than that, like I said, standard egg roll.\nMain course--I had the tangerine chicken and it was delish. Also plated nicely with pieces of tangerine around it--the fresh fruit that is, rind and all. The taste was very sweet meets spicey--very good combo and a few pieces of fresh steamed broccoli. It also wasn't overwhelmingly saucy. Dad had the shrimp in lobster sauce and he did like it, but he said the lobster did not come through AT ALL. He said not in the taste or the aroma. I have to say that I agree as I also tasted it. The shrimp came through, but no lobster at all.\nOriginally I wanted to get the house special lo mein and swap out the rice (why double start of pasta and rice) with an egg roll and was told it was not possible--I mean really??? It's an egg roll---even a veggie roll or whatever was cheaper would have been fine too. I didn't quite find it great that they were not willing or able to swap out that two, even for an upcharge if necessary, especially since rice and pasta together is somewhat redundant.\n\nFor those few reasons listed above, we give it a 3 and 1/2 stars vs 4 stars.\n\nHowever, nice finishes--they give you complimentary place of some sliced fresh seasonal fruit--not a whole lot, but enough for a few bites to change out the flavor of the savory in your mouth and then you get a couple of pieces of chinese candy at the end.\n\nOverall, quite good. They've actually gotten better than they used to be. Before a lot of things were not well flavored, so I was impressed this trip. My dad was a little concerned it was empty when we went, but it was 2:30 in the afternoon in Wynantskill no less. However, when he left, overall he said he was happy.",

                    "text": "0 stars for service\n4 stars for food\n\nMy friend and I decided on this place for our regularly scheduled dinners since we wanted to be more adventurous.  A 7:00pm reservation on a Tuesday night was not a problem and it did not get too busy while we enjoyed our dinner.\n\nOur server did leave a bit to be desired and I felt as if she was trying to rush us, even after I told her that we were there for a leisurely meal.  Minus one star for her alone due to the additional comments below.\n\nWe ordered cocktails - white sangria for me and a cherry-infused Manhattan for him.  Both were delicious in their own way and mine was quite refreshing.  She came back to take our appetizer order of grilled octopus and soft shell crab, then tried to get our entr\u00e9e order but I told her that we would wait, which is not an unusual request.  She then tried to take the wine menu without asking if we were going to have any with dinner and I informed her we would want a bottle later.  Apparently, this surprised her and I seriously began to doubt her skills as a server.\n\nThe appetizers came out and they were amazing.  I loved biting into the soft shell crab and hearing/feeling the snap of the shell right before the flooding of salty juice and sweet meat.  The arugula and sweet corn complemented it nicely with its fresh brightness.  The star of the two was definitely the octopus.  The slight char on the outside really gave it a bit of smokiness.  It was so incredibly tender!  Who ever says that it is rubbery and inedible without being fried needs to come here.  The little potatoes with the lemony sauce was excellent.\n\nThe busboy came by to take away our plates and took my clean fork but left the dirty ones on the appetizer plate.  We looked at each other in amused confusion and I had to ask our server for clean silverware.  My lamb and his shrimp with chorizo did not take too long to come out and the Barbera paired nicely with its very slightly spicy notes.  I loved that the lamb was medium-rare and the braised escarole was salty enough.  However, my meal was cooler in temperature, which made me think it had been sitting there for awhile (ugh, the server again).  I tried a bit of shrimp and chorizo, which was cooked very well and had an amazingly slow heat sauce.  I think I liked that better than my own but that could have been because his was actually hot.\n\nThe busboy tried twice to take my plate before I was finished, which I just find rather rude.  The third time he asked and didn't understand that I was finally done so I had to repeat myself.  Our server dropped dessert menus off without a word.  We ordered the creme brulee and the one perfect cheese but were not informed what it was when we received it.  The creme brulee was too burned on the top and made the carmelized sugar stick to the teeth.  The creme was quite silky and smooth with a balanced vanilla flavour but the biscotti was so hard that I believed it to be stale.  I have made biscotti from scratch before and it has never been that difficult to bite unless it had been around for several days.\n\nOur server dropped off the check and we continued talking.  She came back, opened it up, saw no card, and then walked away.  I moved it to the other side so she wouldn't do that again.  We finally paid and I actually tipped her 20% when she honestly did not deserve it.  However, the food was so amazing that I would come back without complaint again.",

                    "text": "I waited until the \"newness to the area\" hype sort of died out before visiting this Joe's Crab Shack location (former Dakota Steakhouse) at Latham Farms. I already have a Joe's Crab Shack (Methuen, MA) located about 20 minutes from my NH home, which opened earlier this year and the place is not mobbed anymore.\n\nI've been to the Latham Joe's Crab Shack twice in the past month. During opening week, there was a line literally out the door with mobs of people waiting to be seated and the bar area was standing room only. One month later to today, I decided to stop here for lunch around 11:30 AM when there was no wait to be seated. The manager opened the front door as I entered the restaurant and directed to the hostess stand for immediate seating. \n\nThe layout of the place has the bar area in the front, open dining room & \"dancefloor\"  with speakers & disco lights in the center and a greenhouse dining room to the westside of the building. There's also a small pirates playground outside in back for the lil kids!\n\nI am very familiar with their menu since I dine at the Joe's Crab Shack near my home quite often and been to other locations in TX and CA several years ago. They offer mostly seafood dishes, sandwiches, chowders, and appetizers at moderate prices, as well as a variety of crab steampots, which are on the pricier side. \n\nFor lunch, I ordered the Blackened Wahoo Sandwich ($11.69) with Fries and a Classic Steampot ($22.99*), which was served to me about 15 minutes. The waitress put a bib on me and as the steampot was served, was told to prepare for a \"crab facial\" as the lid was lifted off the pot and the whiff of steamed crab legs puffed out. All of the tools I needed to crack and eat the crab came in a metal bucket.\n\n*The Classic Steampot actually cost me only $10 (voucher) for donating to the NO KID HUNGER fund raiser by Joe's Crab Shack back in September.\n\nThe blackened wahoo sandwich was good, which had a firm soft texture with lettuce, tomatoes on a thick soft bun. The fries were salted and crispy golden. \n\nThe Classic Steampot had dungeoness crab, snow crab legs, boiled shrimp (peel & eat), sweet corn on the cob, spicy sausage, and boiled small potatoes. The crab was pretty good and easy to crack open. However, the potatoes and corn on the cob were very firm and the steampot could've used some more hot water to soften the texture of the accompaniments. I enjoyed a Classic Steampot exactly one week ago at the Methuen, MA location and the food was steamed perfectly there.\n\nAs I was eating, the charismatic staff did a dance routine together around the perimeter of the center dining room floor with party lights and music blasting over the speakers. I actually finished off the food in one sitting and the waitress was ready to give me a takeout box (not needed today). She did try to offer me dessert, but I declined as she suggested I get a dessert to go (upsell action attempt). I would've gotten a dessert only if it came in mini size like offered at other chains including Uno Chicago Grill, Applebee's, Ninety Nine Restaurant, and the Olive Garden. (suggestion!) \n\nAnyhow, I had a good lunch here. The food was good to decent and the service was solid good here. The waitress checked up on my progress during the meal and the manager held the front door open as I entered and exited the restaurant and also asked if I had a good meal. The staff at the other Joe's Crab Shack near my home are not as lively as the folks here.",

                    "text": "Best trip we ever had ended w/ the worst experience at Apple Farm Inn & I'll never darken their doors again.\n\nI had stayed here a yr or so back & had the best time ever - sis & I took Mom down to visit Hearst Castle & stopped over for the night & it was such a treat.  The room was spacious w/ a couch & little fireplace.  We were also greeted w/ this huge, personally-addressed, welcome-gift basket containing all kinds of apple goodness ranging from apple scented lotion to homemade jams & apple butter.  Service was impeccable; free cider & cookies in the lobby - I left thinking, man, I can't wait to stay here again!\n\nFlash forward to a group of friends going out for a day of wine tasting in Paso Robles.  I made our reservation MONTHS in advance & bragged & bragged on how happy they would be at Apple Farm Inn.  Talk about eating my words!\n\nTowards the end of our outing, it starts raining like nobody's business - torrential rain where you can barely see the road.  We checked into Apple Farm, drenched, tired, & absolutely starving for a good hot meal, only to discover that we had been placed in this super-small room, right next to & I mean RIGHT NEXT TO the highway.  It was so incredibly loud & when we called the front desk to inquire about our room - we were told that it was room I had signed up for.  Compared to the room I previously had, this was like a Super 8 hotel w/ nothing but 2 double beds - no kitsch at all.  \n\nTHEN we come upon the super-small gift basket left for us, it's addressed to SOMEONE ELSE.  I had my confirmation that this was not our intended room - so went back out in the pouring rain, over to the lobby & busted them on the room deal & they reluctantly admit they gave our room away, placed me in a cheaper room but were charging me the price I had originally been charged for, the \"better\" room.....oh, and now they were completely booked & that was the only room they had.  Needless to say we left immediately & drove back to SF - 4 hours in the torrential rain.\n\nYou might think the saga ends here - but it doesn't.  I wrote a letter to the management staff to tell them about my experience & instead of writing back to apologize, they called me to say it was not their fault b/c there were \"extenuating\" circumstances.  I had not left my phone number in my letter & actually asked they not call but call me they did.  I never spoke to them but the lady left about 2 messages & the 2nd was even snippier than the 1st; only saying it was not their fault.....NEVER an apology, but actual anger that I was not there to hear their excuse.  I mean, what customer service management school did you go to - no apology?!\n\nI couldn't believe the service I received the night I was there & was absolutely appalled by the treatment I received from their management after the fact.  Needless to say, I'll never stay there again & warn all my friends not to book there either.",

                    "text": "I'd just like to put in an edit to note that the owners responded to this review to look in to the potential food poisoning, which is pretty damn good business, I think.  To be fair, I didn't (couldn't) go to the doc, so I can't confirm that it was food poisoning, but it was much more than a \"something didn't agree with me\" case (still not totally back to normal), and I didn't notice any additional symptoms that would signal an allergic reaction.   \n\nEither way - I'll never eat oysters again, and good on their part for doing what they can to ensure that this doesn't happen to another customer.  I'd still like to try the brunch, so I'll review again once I go back for that (someone else here reviewed their doughnuts, and I can't say that I've ever met a doughnut that didn't love me as much as I loved it, so that should be safe!)\n\n\n-----------\n\nMy Craigie experience was, in the end, pretty bad.\n\nI went for dinner at the bar with someone who is a far more adventurous eater than I, and who wanted to share everything (and who was also paying).  So between the two of us, we had the pumpkin soup, the duck-fat roasted brussel sprouts, the oysters, the terrines, and the burger.  \n\nWe started with the oysters and the terrines... I wasn't a huge fan of the terrines, and although I had only had oysters once before (admittedly not a huge fan of seafood), the oysters were incredible, and had a bit of a lemony after-taste.  nom.  I was not at all a fan of the brussel sprouts (but I had never had them before, so...).\n\nThe soup was really quite tasty, as was the little grilled cheese sandwhich that came with it.  The burger was insanely messy but also full of buttery, meaty flavor.  The fries were ok.  They should really consider sweet potato fries, that would have been a bonus.  \n\nSomeone else commented that the bread was cold, and indeed it was.  From what you're paying at Craigie, I'd expect piping-hot, from-the-oven fresh bread.  Still, it was quite tasty.  \n\nSo what was the problem?  We left the restaurant at 11 ish... at about 2 am, I was hardcore paying homage to the porcelain gods, which happened several more times until 5 am, and I'm still feeling pretty queasy.  I have no idea what happened - I only had half a glass of wine, so maybe it was the oysters, maybe the medium-rare burger, maybe a delayed reaction to my newfound disdain for brussel sprouts.  \n\nI'd love to try their brunch, so maybe I'll consider going back to try that after I can hold down food again.",

                    "text": "This is one of America's best breakfast joints.  \n\nThe food is awesome and always a little different, depending on what is on hand your homefries might come with extra broccoli or you might get a whole banana on the side.  They always use just the right amount of butter and oil to fry up the delights served here.  The coffee hits the spot, and the waitpersons are eager to bring water for those patrons parched from a night of drinking.  I strongly recommend trying the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich, even now, thousands of miles away, I can picture the buttered bread collapsing around the hot cheesy links and the delicious scrambled egg inside.  The eggs benedict is also real good, and sometimes I skip breakfast and go straight for the cheeseburger, which is actually a patty melt!\n\nService is a cut above most Cambridge restaurants.  They are pretty much run by one family, the children, polite and friendly serve and wash the dishes, the father, as many men now do, is in charge of cooking, and the matriarch runs the show.  She is very friendly, but as the boss she has no time for shenanigans or people keeping the door open when there is a blizzard outside.  They usually remember who you are too, depending on how busy it is, although that means you have to tell them you don't want 'the usual.'  \n\nLocation is lovely too, right in Cambridge's grit square and only steps from the red line it is easy to see why this place gets so busy on the weekends.  It is across the street from the Middle East and T.T. the Bears or whatever that place is called, and it is always fun to get one of the window booths and watch the different types of musical groups getting setup for the night ahead.  \n\nThe clientele is a more or less inoffensive cross-section of central square's rising star.  You might see more people you know than you'd expect for such a small place, but if any particularly unsavory characters from your past appears in the booth next to you, well take another bite of your sausage, egg and cheese sandwich and forget about them.  There must be quite a few harvard and mit students since the place was significantly less crowded when the students were out on break.  \n\nTiming is the one thing that sucks about his place.  They don't open until 8:30am, so if you work, you can't eat there during the week.  On the weekends you'll never have to wait if you get there before 9:30 and usually after 12pm you are safe too, otherwise I have never waited more than 15 minutes for America's best breakfast.  \n\nThe art on the walls comes from Out of the Blue gallery, so if you like their work then you'll like this art.  My artistic friend who goes by the name \"Herbert,\" gets very upset at what he views as the low-kitsch quality of the picture-rendered paintings and their high prices.  However, you will never find high prices on the menu.",

The food is mediocre and the service, quite simply, sucks. \n\nI went in for the first time in a long time last night, and I was promptly seated. The server I started off with was very freindly and attentive, I knew right away that I wanted a California Burger, and just water. Somewhere down the road something changed, and another guy came up and asked me \"how many of you?\" and I told him it's just me and I already ordered. He gave me a snooty look and disappeared. When my burger was ready, a man was wandering up and down past the booths saying \"california burger? california burger?\" looking confused as to which table it went to. Finally he made it to my section, and literally CHUCKED the plate at the table without so much as a word, eye contact,  or perhaps a \"is there anything else I can get you?\".\nSo I had to wait until my second server came around, and I asked him for some Mayo and Hot Sauce. He disappeared to a register kiosk and proceeded to stand there for 5 minutes when he could have whisked me those two simple things instead of leaving me to sit there with a burger going cold. So I flagged down my first waitress and she happily got me what I needed in a few seconds. \n\nThe burger itself was not worth $10. The beef was moderate quality but it was overcooked to my specification, medium rare. Good quality bacon, fresh veggies though. The side of potato salad was drippy and bland - I dare say that Safeway makes a better potato salad. \n\nMy water went unfilled the entire time, I had to ask for a refill. I ordered a piece of Apple pie warmed up for dessert, they forgot that order. Finally I saw my server look at me sitting there waiting and I could tell from his expression he forgot me. Finally I was brought my apple pie about 15 minutes later - with no fork. Which I had to wait for again. \n\nThe apple pie was soggy, flavorless, and mediocre. I could crap a better pie than this. Overall, Mel's Drive-In up in the city is a big chain and they make a better pie, a better burger, have better service, and better prices. Sad, because I like supporting the little mom and pop places. \n\nI had a lot of time to sit around waiting when I had dinner last night and from what I gathered their wait staff is straight out of high school and completely unprofessional in everything they do. \n\nWouldn't come here again except to try the milkshakes maybe.",

                    "text": "This review is strictly for breakfast.  Synapse also has sandwiches, pizza, and other goodies for lunch, but I've only been here for lunch a few times.\n\nI love the location.  It's very close to all of my classes.  I pass this place every morning when I walk to class.\n\nHowever, whatever time I save by going to a physically convenient place is wasted by the time I always spend waiting for food/drinks.  This morning, I was the only person in there (at 7:30AM), so I decided to get an omlette.  It did not come out until 7:50.  Yes, I kid you not.  Maybe I was the first person to get an omlette this lovely morning, so they didn't turn on the burners yet?  I don't know.  But all that I know is that I ran out of time and couldn't even eat my breakfast since I had class at 8:00.  Saved it to eat during break in the middle of class, so it was no longer hot.  Annoying.  \n\nI'm not much of a breakfast person and I only eat breakfast when I know that I won't be able to eat lunch that day.  I'm not a fan of many breakfast foods anyway.  But, the omlettes here are pretty good.  For about $4, you get an omlette the size of half of a dinner plate.  The other half is filled with yummy potatoes.  The veggie omlette is my fave because I find most breakfast meat to be overly salty.  Today, I decided to be different.  I had the Denver omlette, which contains ham.  My salty-meat theory unfortunately proved to be correct.  The ham tasted good, though slightly salty, but then I was thirsty the whole day!  :(\n\nSynapse loads your omlette with veggies and/or meat so you can count on getting a super FAT omlette. They are not weak on your toppings AT ALL.  However, the actual egg part of the omlette was too thin.  It had the thickness of a crepe.   I would rather have an egg crepe stuffed with veggies than an eggy mess with toppings sprinkled on.  Today's omlette was a disappointment though because I had to eat it lukewarm.\n\nCoffee is okay.  Pretty much the same as anywhere else on campus.  If I absolutely need to get my caffeine fix, I just get the regular house blend iced coffee.  It surprises me that the wait for this drink is relatively long.  If I went anywhere else on campus, I could get my drink in like 2 seconds.\n\nPastries are overpriced.  I love me some almond croissants, so I had to try it here.   It was actually really plain and somewhat soggy.  It cost $3.  If you're looking for a bomb diggity almond croissant, go to Whole Foods.  It's ridiculously OMNOMNOM for about $2.\n\nSynapse is nothing special, but it's a decent cute little place.  The outside eating area is a big plus.  However, a major no-no is the wait time.   Definitely not a place that I would go to when I'm counting on getting something quick.",

                    "text": "Disclaimer:  This is a review only for the Bayou Bends Museum which is just a small part of the MFA.  \n\nI came here a few months ago for an event that was just stunning.  They had it lit with nice, ambient lights that provided the perfect atmosphere to enjoy the gardens and the buildings.  There was quiet music, wonderful food (with a great waitstaff), and free access to this part of the museum.\n\nThe grounds are incredibly well kept and it is the kind of place that makes you want to bring your camera and a macro lens.  All the vibrant colors make me wish I had a green thumb.\n\nThe building itself has been preserved well, though the lack of a tour guide was a bit disconcerting.  There isn't nearly as much information on the walls as I'd like for a museum, but it was fine for just a quiet event.  \n\nI'd like to come back again and see if I can get a guided tour of the house.  It is small and would only take about an hour to see everything in detail, but I think it would be worth it.  On my list of things to do is check out the other campuses of the MFA.\n**********************************************************\nOkay, I finally checked out the rest of the MFA and was pretty impressed.  Not enough to give it that extra star, but enough to become a patron.  \n\nBeing in such a large city has many advantages and our museum showcases a great one--we get some big name shows in town!  Since I'm not a music person, that venue never does much for me.  But the fact that we can get things like the Lucy exhibit at the Natural Science Museum and the Miwa Yanagi at the MFA makes me a happy camper.  \n\nEveryone is incredibly friendly, the exhibits are fantastic, and parking is pretty cheap ($3) in the garage.  Thursday nights has free general admission and it just doesn't get better than that.  Especially if you have kids and want to have a fun, educational, and cheap trip, there isn't much better in Houston.\n\nThe other great thing about the MFA is the amazing gift store.  I mean, there were books EVERYWHERE!  We were in heaven.  It took more will power than I knew existed in my body to walk away without buying one single book.  And there were a lot to choose from.  I was especially impressed with the great collection of architecture books they had and the fun knick knacks (I loved the jewelery, of course) lying around.\n\nNext time, I plan to take my camera so I can take plenty of pictures while on the grounds.  There are so many great photo ops with interesting sculptures everywhere.  Plus, this is the perfect time in Houston to go out and enjoy the sun since it isn't scorching hot yet!",

                    "text": "Not sure why there are two results, so just in case you didn't see the other reviews: \n\nI will never go anywhere else. I lucked up when I found out about this place. My coworker heard that there were discounted gift certificates to a spa on a local radio stations webpage. They were $50 GC for $25. Suhweet! So I bought 6 and my sister bought 4. (Hey, I was thinking ahead.) Well, the radio station made a  mistake when they purchased them and everybody got $100 GC instead of $50. As soon as I got mine I called the station and told them what happened. Basically they said, 'Oops, Merry Christmas!' Holy hot stones, Batman! We got $1000 worth of spa gift certificates for $250. This really should be a review for the station; I'll do that later. \n\nAnyhoo, so my sister and I call mom and grandma and schedule a 'pampering day'. It was HEAVEN. We arrived and checked in. They took us to a private dressing room. The  room had several lockers with keys. When you open your locker there is a robe and pair of slippers waiting for you. Next, your attendant comes to take you to your treatment. I had the Sea Fango body wrap. Very cool. I got on top of the table that was covered in a sheet of shiny metallic-looking plastic wrap. My attendant rubbed a seaweed based substance all over me. Next, she wrapped me burrito-style in the plastic wrap and  put a blanket over me. Then, I was left to relax in peace. When the attendant came back I asked her if the treatment was effervescnet beecause I felt bubbles. She explained that the heat from the table provided the heat portion of the treament and the seaweed stuff was actually simmering around me. I finished my detoxing seaweed sweat and showered in the in-room rain shower. To complete my treatment I hopped back up on the table and had an aromatherapy message.\n\nI finished before everyone else and I really thought they were gonna kick me out and make we wait in the lobby. I was mistaken. Instead I was escorted to a lounge room and they brought me sweat fruity drinks while I waited for my mom, sister and grandma to join me. They all had second treatments schedule. (I suprised my sis with a mani/pedi). They drifted in and out and I actually feel asleep in my chaise while I waited for them to finish. One of the attendants asked me if I wanted to enjoy the whirlpool while I waited. Well, since they asked so nicely I did! By the way, this whirlpool was in a room off of the private dressing room and it had a sauna and a 5 shower head shower.\n\nMy mom said her treatments were so good she wanted to marry the guy that gave her the message. My sister didn't want to leave (she was moving to Cali the next day.) My grandma keeps asking when we're doing it again. They made all of us feel like movie stars. In the end, I had $100 of GC left so I'll be heading back soon for some solo pampering.",

                    "text": "OH. MY. GOD.\n\nSome context- I am a misplaced Southerner, having grown up in North Carolina, who has been living in Boston for almost nine years. So when I walked in and saw boiled peanuts.... and Virginia country ham... and spoon bread... and motherfuckin' all-you-can-drink sweet tea... well, you can't blame a man for a-whoopin' and a-hollerin', can you?\n\nI am not entirely exaggerating when I say that I have been dreaming of a restaurant like Hungry Mother the entire time I've lived here. It's a little slice of home, combined with some serious French cookin' chops. The chef is an Appalachian Virginian who managed to escape (and believe me, that is a rough place) to the New England Culinary Institute. He didn't forget where he came from, though, and thank God for that because who needs yet another French or fusion restaurant?\n\nI started my meal with some boiled peanuts. They were fresh and not at all salty, which was certainly different. My wife said \"it's almost like eating a vegetable!\" Me, I could've used some more salt... ok, a lot more salt, but I will freely admit that I like my boiled peanuts to taste like a salt lick. The pork rilletes were coarse, not smooth, and seriously smoky-porky- I think there was a lot of belly meat in there. Good stuff. \n\nFor an appetizer, I had a big ol' plate of the prosciutto of the South, Virginia country ham. Man alive! Good stuff. Sliced nice and thin, with some good olives and a fig compote, it was heaven on a plate. I paired my ham with the Champagne of Beers, a steal at only $3 a bottle. My wife enthusiastically tucked in to a bowl of shrimp and grits. Now, I have eaten the archetypal shrimp and grits at Crook's Corner (where Bill Neal invented the dish) so to me they weren't that exciting- too soupy. The ham was a nice touch though.\n\nFor my entree, I rocked out with my rib out- braised pork shoulder with one single perfect smoky rib and grits. That rib. Let's just say that pig did not die in vain. Intensely smoky, super rich pork flavor. The grits were very good- not Quaker out of a bag, but definitely something like Anson Mill stone-ground grits with a nice chunky texture. My wife had the roasted chicken with spoon bread. SPOON BREAD, folks! I haven't had that since my grandma cooked it for me when I was a wee one. The chicken was moist, but with a nice crispy skin and subtle herb flavors. \n\nWhew! I think that's a sufficiently exhaustive accounting of our meal. I will be back, that's for damn sure, and in the hot summer months I will drink buckets of sweet tea. Speaking of which, the bourbon, limoncello, and sweet tea cocktails is not to be missed- neither is the sorghum mint julep. Although if I tell my Mom I went to a restaurant that charges $9 for a drink made with what is essentially Karo syrup (\"that's for poor people!\") she'll laugh her head off. I'm looking forward to trying more of the cocktails, which are inventive but grounded in traditional cocktail-making, and aren't 27 different combinations of flavored vodka.\n\nSo anyway, Yankees, Southerners, Hatfields, McCoys- check out Hungry Mother. It's the most exciting addition to Boston dining I've seen in ages.",

                    "text": "Ahh Sheraton properties. I normally stay at Hyatt hotels, the service and quality is always fantastic. But when a Hyatt is not an option, I usually got with a Sheraton. So here is a review for the Sheraton La Jolla. First the good. The bed's are VERY comfortable, or at least they were in my room. I slept very well. Other perks include free Wi-Fi access and Starbucks coffee and tea. Touch sensitive lamps are an unexpected convenience. Breakfast was pretty damn good in the restaurant - Eggs Benedict - very tasty. Now the bad ... the thermostat is impossible to control. If it is on it is too loud and the room is too cold or too hot. I ended up unplugging it after a day since it became so annoying. The design of the bathroom was not done professionally. There is about 1cm of clearance between the door and the toilet when you are entering and existing the bathroom. Basically, its like an airplane. You are either in or out, and if you and your partner are trying to get ready at the same time ... good luck. It will suck. My gf and I had to keep re-positioning ourselves so we could actually prepare; and we are both thin, lanky Asians LOL. Staff was pretty bad at refilling the coffee. Either they forgot to give us regular coffee and just left all decaf. Or left not sugar. Or no creamer. I had to call every single day I was there to have this serviced even after \"room-service\" had already serviced the room. And when they came by they were still unprepared ... and forgot to bring the creamer or ... yes ... brought shaving cream instead. Not kidding. Umbrella. So the weather in San Diego was poor. Worse than NYC in November. There is an umbrella hanging in each and every closet, but it is small. A one-person umbrella. I went to the front desk and asked for an extra but they said the only umbrellas they had were in the closets. Poor planning on the part of the property for sure. A few other thing, the hotel is close to UCSD and a small strip mall that has a Whole Foods and a few other establishments. But it is in reality, far from anything you really want to do in San Diego. Cab service is TERRIBLE. I had to wait over an hour after the hotel already called one for me. Then they had to call for me again, a second time and put in a priority call. So if you don't have a car, be prepared to pay the price. Public transportation and taxis in San Diego are shit. And if you do have a car ... you'll pay the price too ... parking at the Sheraton is and extra $10 per day. Overall, this is not my first Sheraton property and I've even stayed in what is supposedly the high-end Westin in Shanghai on the Bund. This is pretty much how it always is. But sometimes it's the only option ... I enjoyed my stay but the Sheraton La Jolla still has a lot to work on.",

                    "text": "First of all, I  used to work here, but that was after I became a regular at this joint. \n\nDue to the location, Sushi Niichi mainly serves the UT crowd and this reflects on their price and fish selection. However, do you really feel like paying bills at Mikado, or Musashino, or Uchi 2-3 times a week? \nGood luck with that. After all, it would be really boring if all sushi restaurants in Austin serve you in the same style with the same fish from the same supplier in Houston and Dallas. \n\nSushi Niichi is cute for its own reason. It never tries to be cool, nor yuppie. It's simply more like a family-run small restaurant where servers/owner/sushi chefs remember your first name, what you always order (we didn't say you are boring), and what you dislike, even though you don't blow hundreds of dollar each time you are here. \n\nNow we can proceed to what the goodies are at Sushi Niichi, shall we?\n\nFor sushi rolls, they do have a good VARIETY. I mean it. On the top of my head, I'd suggest:\nblue moonlight,  spider, crazy, tiger eye, volcano, hard rock, strawberry, Hawaii, golden dragon, and godzilla (see, I wasn't lying when I said I used to work here). \nEach of them packs different kinds of fish and may contain seafood tempura (soft-shell crab or shrimps). Even I self-nominate as hardcore sushi eater, which means I usually care very less about sushi rolls, I can still tell you that these specialty rolls are the shit. As for the tastes, you gotta go there and order by yourself to figure out. I simply would not spoil the fun of discovering great flavors with your own palate. \nThe last thing, please, it's ok to love the simplicity of california/philly roll, but wouldn't you like to try something else to make your sushi diary more interesting?\n\nEnough mumbling, below are the former employee's recommended items at Sushi Niichi. I'm very serious so hopefully you will at least try them.\n\nAppetizer: Calamari, Gyoza, Agadashi tofu, teriyaki style beef stake\n\nSpecial rolls: blue moonlight, spider, crazy, tiger eye, volcano, hard rock, strawberry, Hawaii, golden dragon and godzilla. \nFor vegetarian, veggie tempura, tofu tempura, jade and garden\n\nNigiri/sashimi: depends. Salmon and hamachi are always good. \nWhite tuna (binnaga) serves with slow-roasted crunchy garlic is a must try. \nIf you like salmon roe (ikura), you need to order it. Why? Because unlike some other places, where they count how many ikuras are put down in your sushi (really, kyoto, it's nothing personal),  here it is PACKED with these little eggs. \nRegular shrimp (ebi) cannot satisfy you? Go with the sweet shrimp (ama-ebi). It's served raw and the head/tail parts are deep-fried-crunchy-goodies. \nFor better value, order combo A (five pieces of nigiri with soup and salad), sampler c (8 generous pieces of sashimi), and chirashi's (seriously, I heard some people bitch about the price here. You got to be kidding me. Would you please name any other decent sushi place in Austin serve chirashi below USD15?)\n\nBeer/sake: Kirin, Sapporo, and Asahi are served here. I've always been a Sapporo and Asahi fan. Cold sake are available in draft or ginjo style. Hot sake is available as well.\n\nDessert: Japanese ice cream, mochi ice cream, banana/ apple tempura with ice cream. You will find a way at  to satisfy your sweet tooth.\n\nHidden daily/weekly specials: They have fatty tuna (toro), semi fatty (chu toro), mackerel (saba), octopus (tako), sea urchin (uni) and albacore tuna from time to time Ask your server or sushi chef.",

                    "text": "Blue Nile is located right on campus, but tucked behind Potbelly's sandwich shop in the back an on alley with very very VERY limited parking out front.  But even after a long walk on a hot summer day, I showed up at Blue Nile's front door knowing that it's going to be well worth the sweat (especially since I knew their A/C would not be cranking, but then again, who needs cool air when you can have some delicious spicy food!?!).  Here's the trick to almost guaranteeing yourself a satisfying meal at Blue Nile - ORDER THE SPECIAL!  Their specials are under $12 after tax and there's enough food to get your belly full and still walking away with a doggie bag (if you're not busy stuffing yourself because it's just too yummy to stop eating).  The Lamb Shank is tender and scrumptious (note to self - must try to figure out what is used to marinate it)!  I've had beef (usually ground beef), chicken, lamb specials and have never been disappointed (wish I had written down all their names so I can share here).  The Arabic Salad is great for summer, cucumber and tomato chunks sitting in a cup of lemon juice and minced cilantro, just what I needed to cleanse the palate and cool down a bit.  The Lentil Soup is good, tastes like it was made just before I showed up.  Chicken Shawarma sandwich comes in a pita (dry and not greased, which is how I like my pitas) with onions and tomatoes on the bottom and marinated chicken cubes on top, the Tahini sauce is what really tie the ingredients together.  If ordered as a meal, it would be the chicken on a plate of rice.  Speaking of rice, their rice is very flavorful just by itself, mixing that with whatever sauce that comes with the protein or vegetables of the dish (depending on what entree you get), it will keep getting better and better.  My only gripe about Blue Nile is that I wish they use fresh corn, green beans, and carrots instead of canned ones, but I can imagine using pre-made ingredient instead of having to prepare for fresh ones every day on top of having to mix a million spices together to marinate/soak/rub the proteins and other fresh veggies like eggplants and okras can be overwhelming in that tiny kitchen of theirs, so I suppose they have to choose their battle there.  If they get rid of the canned veggies and up their vegetarian options, I will have no choice but give them a 5 star, saying that I'm a fan is almost an understatement!\n\n***Oh btw, my Muslim friends tell me that Blue Nile serves Halal meat.",

                    "text": "--Kama Sutra Butter Lamb Masala--\n\nI never knew that lamb could taste like sex. \n\nI am new to Seattle and have been learning a lot in the past five months about this region's offerings and am pleased to have stumbled upon Cedars Restaurant on Brooklyn. A few weeks ago I ordered the lamb curry special at the Wild Ginger and although the meat was tender and spices balanced, they (the meat and spices) did not sing me into satisfaction, and in spite of the waiters' sincere praise of the dish, I was disappointed. So when my boss suggested that we order Lamb Butter Masala from the local Indian restaurant, while working late on a rainy Friday night, I agreed, but mostly because I was hungry and she was buying. As one must, I added Vegetable Pakora and Nan to the order.  Apprehensive about the Lamb in Seattle, I requested Vegetable Curry as a fall back plan. \n\nDisoriented by the crowd of chit-chatty patrons awaiting their turn at a table, and after elbowing my way to the take-out counter, I did not notice until returning to my car that I was carrying 2 large bags of food and only put $34 or so on the company credit card. This was a good sign. The smell of ginger, garlic, cilantro and curry inspired an even deeper hunger, and I ate all the Nan while driving the .5 miles back to the office. \n\nI picked a bottle of Ravenswood Zin (on sale) from QFC and although there was not a wine screw at the office, there was a toolbox. My brilliant and thirsty boss, with her Kiwi ingenuity, used power tools to drill a screw into the wine cork and then I took over with the prong side of a hammer and released the cork from its cramped servitude. By the time we had the wine open and paperwork moved off the conference table to sit down to uncover the take-out, it was still hot. \n\nThis Lamb Butter Masala got me tangled up inside. All tantric and tantalized, my taste buds got wet. Salivating, I licked every last buttery drop and was left satisfied in a heap on the conference chair. My throat burned (in that good way) and my temples and collarbone were damp with sweat. I do not know enough about Indian fare to speak of the specific spices and flavors, but the details do not even interest me--I melted inside--that's all I know. \n\nI did not need the Vegetable Curry, nor did I get any more work done. With leftover rice to feed me through the week, I just sat in a heap for a wile, and then went home to take a cold shower.",

                    "text": "I am stuck at work and all I can think of is this stupid place. I should dock a star for it. But I won't. \n\nI have a long and glorious history with the Cobbler Factory. It started when I wasn't more than 3 and somehow my parents found it. It became a tradition in the Lenox house to go to the weekly CalTech family concert series and then pop over to the CF for some peach cobbler. We would then stop at a grocery store for some milk and head over to a nearby park. Some of my best childhood memories are times I ran around with cobbler syrup smeared all over my face. \n\nI don't go there a lot anymore. I live in Van Nuys, so to go there is a bit of a hike. Nonetheless, I cannot not justify heading over there from my work in Echo Park. The lovely peaches, cooked just right with the smallest bit of a snap left in them nestled in the most delicious crust you'll ever have makes you believe in a higher power. To tell you the truth, for the 18 years I've been going there I've only ever had peach cobbler. Really, why try something new when you've already found perfection? \n\nAll this from a postman with a hobby for making cobbler recipes thirty years ago.\n\nNext Day Update: So after I wrote this review I couldn't concentrate. I had to get to the Cobbler Factory. Two minutes before clock-out I couldn't stand it anymore. I gathered my stuff and punched out. \n\nOn my way to Pasadena I kept on speeding. I would be thinking about the cobbler then look down, see I was pushing 90, slow down, start thinking of the cobbler again and go back up to 90. \n\nOnce I finally got to the parking lot I was a woman obsessed. I drove around the small, but not too small parking lot to find it completely full (the parking lot serves a lot of businesses, not just GCF), I ended up parking in front of the Planetary Society house half way down the block from the GCF. \n\nAs soon as I got out of my car I could smell the sweetness in the air. I am sure there are calories in the air around the store, how could a smell like that come guilt free? I felt like a cartoon character, floating on the smells to the source. I had to keep myself from running.\n\nWhen I got there it looked a little different. Someone mentioned the dolls in another reviews, but I don't remember them before. They're a little cool, they're little \"would-have-freaked-me-out-if-I-was-three.\" The store was empty and all that was keeping me from my treasure was the glass display case. \n\nI did one of those awkward \"hello?\" and a woman came out with a tray of cobbler. Jackpot. I ordered two peach cobblers and a sweet potato pie (the pies are the size of my palm). Then I stopped myself. I've been getting peach for eighteen years, today will be the day I branch out. \"Change one of those peaches to a mix berry.\" I pay the $15.16 for the two cobblers and the pie and left. Again, I had to check myself so as not to run.\n\nAs soon as I got back to the car I popped the cobbler tops. To my utter disappointment the cobblers were not hot. It was okay though, I dealt. I tried the mix berry first. It was o.k. Nothing as special as I remembered the peach being, nothing to drive thirty minutes for. I should say that I'm not too much of a cooked berry person. The berries were tart and sweet and were the best cooked berries I've ever had, but it just didn't float my boat.\n\nI started to panic, what if the peach isn't as good as I remembered either? I cracked the top of the cobbler, dug my fork in, got a good chunk of peach with some crust on it, and quickly shoved it in my mouth. OH MY GOD! It is exactly as amazing as I thought it was going to be. I ate a third of it sitting in my car in front of the planetary society and then drove home. \n\nNone of my purchases lasted the night. I did have help from three people. I am a very, very giving person. \n\nIt's a good thing I'm not in Pasadena a lot. I'd be there all the time. I'm looking forward to the next time, but for now I am satisfied with the most perfect dessert quest of my life.",

                    "text": "The Houston Zoo...there are so many good things to say but some of the downfalls just makes it a simple \"A-OK.\" \n\nI have always loved going to the zoo except when I start to feel sorry for the animals that have such a limited space compared to the natural environment, but then I suck it up and usually enjoy my chance to have a close encounter with animals I would never be able to see in the wild. When I first moved to Houston, the zoo was definitely on my list of things to see. The first time I went was with a bunch of high school students for a field trip so I didn't really count that because well supervising high school students on a field trip does not allow you to really enjoy what the zoo has to offer. So about 2 years later, I finally came back for my \"official\" visit. \n\nThe first thing, parking sucks! I decided to go on a Sunday afternoon when the weather just seemed perfect. Note to self...never again! I would rather get there right when it opens, suffer the heat of summer or the cold of winter, than deal with the craziness of people scrambling for parking spaces and not knowing where they are going. At least the ticket line went by quickly and it wasn't a bad deal, somewhere around 10-12 bucks. I forgot what the zoos cost in California, but I believe around the same price or maybe even more. The one thing about visiting on the weekend are the multitudes of families that visit the zoo for a family outing. OK, I don't have kids, I just work with them. I don't mind them, but I do get annoyed when some people can't control their kids and their running around in enclosed spaces bumping into people and not knowing manners to say sorry or excuse me....please teach this early on, it'll pay off. The aquarium section is pretty small, but then again I realize we're in Houston. It's not really a coastal city with an abundance of native sea life. It does it's job and always makes me want to go back to research in marine biology. Annoying factor, people banging on the glass of the fish tanks. My parents would yell at me if I did anything of the sort to disrupt the animals, but there were so many kids and adults partaking in that activity. I had to get out before I started to go off on them. \n\nThe zoo has many animals and it always seems to be under construction in one way or another. There is a new addition, the Africa exhibit which I thought was going to be more extravagant and well more informational and have a lot more to it. I was very disappointed. The animal encounters were simply OK and a bit on the small side. They had a story that you were supposed to follow, but you couldn't hear the stories or really catch on to the \"myth.\" Some of the touch screen/interactive stations weren't working and once again people were simply annoying. \n\nThis rant could be because I work in the education system and when I see families going to the zoo and exposing their kids to different things, I do get excited because that's a plus for their future. But really please try to teach them while you're there. A kid threw trash into the sea lion tank and the mom laughed and the kid threw more trash and asked his mom if the seals would eat it and she responded \"yea they'll be OK.\" Umm...hmmm...let's think about that? Then another kid asked if a bird was an elephant and this kid was about 6 or 7. Maybe, I'm just too critical. \n\nThe three stars: \n*The animals are great to see but I definitely would go back when it's less crowded so I don't have to deal with the hoards of people \n*Price is OK \n*Parking does suck \n*Some of the zookeepers are very interactive and will answer many of your questions \n*It's a great field trip, since many students have never been to the zoo \n*It can get pretty hot during the summer, but less people go so you can enjoy more things \n*Prices for food and beverages are a bit on the steep side but you can bring coolers and stuff so you can have a picnic of some sort \n\nAll in all...a great place for a family outing, a date, a field trip, photo opportunities.",

                    "text": "If you come here a hungry mother, you surely will not leave as one. Upon walking in, I was immediately taken by the homey (but not hokey) atmosphere and was welcomed by a wonderfully savory aroma. Well, let me cut to the chase here: this place smells like BACON. This is no surprise considering the pig is basically the high priest of Hungry Mother, and Chef Maiden certainly has a way with swine. Okay, mama's definitely hungry now!\n\nAlthough the menu at HM may not be lengthy, each item sounds tantalizing and fresh and presents a unique twist on classic Southern dishes. To tide us over, as the menu says, we started with the Boiled Virginia Peanuts. Who knew such a humble nut, the quintessential bar munchie, could become such a stellar starter? A server brought these to our table covered by another dish in which we were to toss the shells. Piping hot, these jumbo babies released a dramatic stream of steam when revealed. Sprinkled, or should I say, blanketed in good Maine sea salt, each nut, bean-like in texture and taste, profited from the salt that sticks to your fingers as you rip into the shells. All hail the profound peanut - this is the most playful starter I've had. Since we knew we had a rich adventure ahead of us, we passed on a real appetizer and decided to have a side before dinner instead. And what could be lighter than a side of cornbread doused in molasses-y butter? Well, luckily, the gritty, savory, Southern-style molded cornbread, which was delightfully brown and crisp on the outside (I think it was pan-fried), was nothing like our Yankee version and was heightened, not overwhelmed, by the melty topping of a sweet, but earthy, Sorghum butter. \n\nSometimes great apps overshadow the main dishes, but our meals were just as exciting. A play on chicken and dumplings was just fabulous and was not at all heavy. Instead of being submerged, a warm and garlicky roast chicken leg quarter with perfectly crisp skin (I'm a stickler for crisp skin) was cut into about 6 pieces and rested atop the dumplings (gnocchi), still-crunchy chunks of carrot, and still-verdant collards swimming in a beautiful broth which was not too thin, but not thick like gravy. The gnocchi was different than some might be used to: the soft French-style pillows, made like a p\u00e2te \u00e0 choux, had a great herbal quality with a slight lemony bite to brighten up this warm bowl of love. I had to choose the oft-mentioned catfish. The cornmeal coating was so very crispy and had a great texture that other breading lacks. It was seasoned fabulously but didn't at all take away from the delicate flavor of the perfectly cooked catfish. Its zippy bed of dirty rice with house-made andouille was to die for! I wanted the crisp celery slaw on top to be cold, but even warm, it did its job. The only non-harmonious element was a drizzling of flavorless paprika oil. Aesthetically, it just looked, well, oily.\n\nStuffed to the gills and wishing elasticized waste bands were socially acceptable, we couldn't leave without sampling the best desserts I've had in a while. Let the gluttony continue! Our very seasonal apple steamed pudding was warm and moist with a lovely maple taste. A barely sweetened cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche was the perfect topping. The tasty apple compote on the side also brightened the dish, but perhaps a little too much. It was very cold, a bit too acidic, and needed some cinnamon. But the apple chunks had a nice bite. It came with the BEST shortbread cookie which was salty with a buttery toffee flavor. The second dessert, a burnt caramel pot de cr\u00e8me was simple genius. The burnt caramel flavor gave it so much more depth than your average pot-de-cr\u00e8me. It was salted and topped generously with a light cocoa chantilly. It wrapped up all of the virtues of a good salted caramel. Wow, this was an unforgettable dessert (I will try to forget that the very bottom was a bit watery and that it was served with an unnecessary cherry biscotti)! \n\nNow as a food-lover, I usually do not bark about service, and I will not knock off a star, but this did leave a sour taste in my mouth (cured by the little chocolate-peanut butter oat candies given with the check). It's a small place with a big crowd, but our waiter was rushing us before we even got our peanuts. In addition, a party of two, which in the restaurant's defense had been there since before we arrived, was told they would have to leave. I'm not sure what you can do if you have people with reservations waiting; however, this was a bit off-putting and acerbic for me. After a long, hard workweek, a trip to Hungry Mother is comforting, and I don't believe anyone should be forced to shovel food down. Then again, I've never managed a restaurant...\n\nDespite this, Hungry Mother brings Southern Comfort up North, pleasing the Bostonian palate.",

That awkward, adolescent gawky stage.  \n\nYou're trying to pick an identity more painfully than you will cycle through them without thought during your first year of college.  You are aware, on some level, that if you pick wrong, you are doomed to six years of junior high plus high school and only getting two handjobs because of being known as \"that weird guy\" that \"I think he might bus tables at someplace downtown\"?  Or worse, \"the weird guy, the one who keeps on looking at me and it is *so* gross\".\n\nYou are trying desperately to sniff out the pavement.  Are you called to be a rebel without a cause with a shredded board?  Are you going to get known as \"that really cool guy who seems pretty smart, but he's quiet\" or \"that really nerdy guy\"?  Should you answer in algebra class?  Should you be a class clown and try to toe the line between obnoxious and hilarious?  Can you be the guy in the school who doesn't do sports *and* wears a fedora but *still* gets all the chicks?\n\nWell, Harvest, your identity crisis is just as bad.  Because you can't figure out what you want.  And I can't blame you because neither can Cambridge.\n\nYou started out as an earnest, hippie-dippy crunchy granola start-up co-op.  Everyone eagerly paid their dues and was really proud of the way you kept on growing and ignored the fact that your produce and groceries were more expensive, but hey, this is a local effort, to bring a market to the people, and if they had to dig a little deeper into their wallets for that scrappy, can-do grocer, they would.\n\nAnd over the years, Bread & Circus beat you up.  A lot.  At first, you could shrug it off.  But soon, it began to feel like you were on the wrong side of a conflict in Oz or 24, you were doomed.  But you had these great community roots!\n\nAnd you called us to rally.  \"A grocer from Texas bought Bread & Circus!  You're not going to stand for that, are you?\"  And being Cantabrigians, we cheered.\n\nAnd being the absolute whores that we are, we slowly started gravitating to the store that did have what we wanted in stock, did know what convenience food was, and would even tell us it was organic and preservative-free.  (How it can then survive flash-freezing without burning is something we didn't really want to know.)   They flattered us.  They said, \"Here, let me arrange a sexy hot plate of dinner for you for $8.\"  Yea, though we knew that your bulk flourr bins had merit, the smell of dough baked by someone else and formed into an appetizing, work-free loaf was as seductive as a Lorelei.  Whole Foods says, \"You're beautiful for caring enough about the environment and sustainable agriculture.  Here.  Let me show you what I can do for you.\"\n\nSo, you went on the rebound.  You decided to court all the Area 4 locals, the people who had wandered in twice and wandered back out confused wondering why everything cost 3 times as much as Star Market and none of the brand names matched.  \n\nYou put aside some of the bulk produce bins -- no one was buying unground wheat flour in bulk, and it's because they didn't appreciate you enough, but you can change, you can get past it.\n\nSo you stock Cheez-Its and Coca-Cola and Campbell's Soup.  You always accepted food stamps and WIC -- it was socially inconscionable to exclude anyone, no matter how impoverished, from the organic food culture.  Now you put the stickers on the door.  You sent flyers to the surrounding neighbourhoods.\n\nSome people came in.  But they wondered why you only had a single rack of Coca-Cola and most of the brand names didn't make sense, and the one time they brought home the mac and cheese, it tasted like dirt.  So, you tried to solicit their feedback.  But unlike the earnest, shiny-eyed local activists, these people did not want to join you for community meetings.  They didn't want to fill out comment cards or participate in surveys about their feelings on consumer brands.  They wanted to yell at the manager, swear on their way out the door and not come back.\n\nAnd this is where you've stayed.\n\nI wish you the best in surviving adolescence and getting a nice girlfriend.\n\nIf you want to talk about this some more, we can meet in the frozen foods section at Trader Joe's, which is where everyone who was still broke from working at non-profits or as artists went as soon as they opened.\n\nBut really, Harvest, don't even think I'm your girlfriend.  I'm not ready for that commitment.",

                    "text": "When it comes to Thai food in the University District, all signs seem to point exclusively to Thai Tom. I don't know why, but people really make a big deal about this place. Best Thai food in Seattle? Maybe if all the more spacious and comfortable ones in the area are somehow inferior. That's not to say this place is anything short of excellent, or that I doubt in its ability to stand up to the competition. The food here is simply outstanding. Whether it's a better Thai restaurant than all the other ones in town is another question, but what is certain is that you really can't go wrong with any money spent here.\n\nBecause I knew how popular this place is and how limited the seating would be, I anticipated it getting full shortly after opening. I stood outside and waited until 11:30 AM with a handful of other eager customers. By 11:35, nearly every seat was taken. It was then that I realized I was dealing with serious business. While I was lucky enough to be seated, I saw the waiter turn away a few people and ask them to come back later because there just wasn't enough space to accomodate them. I don't know whether to be impressed by that, but if they're so successful, I wonder why they can't afford to get a bigger place.\n\nThe place itself, if the other reviews haven't made it obvious by now, is constantly busy and crowded. It looks old, worn out, and generally unpleasant. But it's a restaurant and not a museum where you marvel at artwork. The air here is pretty much always thick with the smell of delicious fried food. The kitchen isn't in its own separate room way in the back and out of the public eye; the cooks make your food right in front of your eyes. Consequently, it can also get rather hot, especially if you sit by the fires. But all this food is definitely worth the trouble. No matter how long you have to wait, you can be entertained by the aroma of other customers' meals and the display of the food being made.\n\nSince so much of the fun of eating here comes from watching the cooks make everything, I'd suggest getting one of the seats at the counter near the front of the restaurant, kind of in the corner. It's a spectacular display, although not as ostentatious as teppanyaki. The cooks' hands move with astounding speed. They'll grab from the ingredients around them, crack eggs single-handedly, and noisily clatter the woks around as they perform all their cooking in a seemingly effortless manner. It's nice being able to see exactly how all this food is prepared, especially if it's obvious that it's being done by people who clearly have a lot of experience.\n\nThe menu here is something of an oddity. Instead of the usual thin and light paper menus, the ones here appear to be entirely painted on wooden planks. My first instinct was actually to take it as a joke, but I realize that it may have been a stylistic choice. I suppose they're really going for that authentic Thai feel here. From the rather brief list of hardly more than thirty items, I ordered the Phad Thai for $7.50. This restaurant is supposedly top-tier, but I wanted to get the most basic dish before venturing onward to their more \"specialized\" delicacies. I got it with chicken and three stars on the spicy scale from one to five.\n\nAlthough there was quite a long queue of customers who had already placed their orders before I could get a chance to, it's almost not a concern because it was such a delight watching the guy cooking the meals jump from making one person's dish to another. It's amazing how he never seemed to mess up, too. On numerous occasions, it looked like he was stirring the food too carelessly and would make a mess, but he always seemed to catch it in his wok. The show had an almost mesmerizing quality to it. I don't know why I get such a kick out of watching one person multitask so efficiently. It's an entirely missed opportunity if you get seated at one of the tables to the side, away from where all the action is taking place. For this reason, I would not recommend coming here with too large and cumbersome of a group. Either way, it's quite possible to get seated right next to a complete stranger here.\n\nMy much-awaited lunch arrived with the chicken Phad Thai on one side of a long bowl, a clump of white rice occupying the other side, and a wedge of lime adjacent to all this. Sizzling in front of me, it looked and smelled like quite a feast, although I couldn't help but notice that it was... disappointingly small. To be fair, it was a very inexpensive dish, but insufficient as a whole meal for a voracious eater like me. All petty complaints, because the food itself was without a doubt among the best of Thai cuisine I've ever experienced. A sweet taste was dominant with this Phad Thai; I guess they had skimped on the spiciness, but I won't hold it against them. I may have exaggerated the flaws, but they're all insignificant when you consider that this is just about as close to perfection for Thai food in Seattle to feasibly reach.",

Their number one priority is safety. Including being harsh when it comes to age requirements. You must be 18 to be tattooed, no matter what. Sterile environments and health protocol are their concerns. \n\nAll artists have portfolios, look at them before you look at the flash!\n\nRueben - Great old school style and a perfectionist, application is phenonemal and paintings are displayed elsewhere. Funny and ask him about his meatball...\nJohn - Realism, black and grey are his specialty. Loves doing giant pieces in color as well. Tells great stories, loves to socialize and make it a great experience.\nKelly - Is a BOY. You will love his rockabilly flair and quick wit. Pin-ups are his forte . He's from texas and loves to bring his southern creativity to each piece. No mess'n around, he means business. TCB\nEllen - she's a bitch, but I love her. She's hot and her portraits will rock your world\nJase - knows a tattoo machine like it's his life. Technical and superior knowledge makes his tattoos stay even after you're dead.\nSkye - just moved here from San Diego, his portfolio is crazy! Haven't any anything done from him, yet. But man does he love colors.\n\nThey do not charge EXTRA for custom pieces. What moronic, eager art school kids don't understand about a tattoo is the life of the tattoo. So getting an entire song tattooed on your wrist in tiny letters won't work. When you put ink too close together it will bleed together in a couple years . Go ahead and look at your stupid friends tattoo in about 5 years, they are going to be begging for someone to fix it. Try to be open minded and realize these guys know what they're talking about. Otherwise they could just take your money and not even care what your tattoo would look like in a few years. And remember they give this shpeel to almost every customer they tattoo. \n\nCustom work means THEY draw. Use your ideas and make it tattooable.  Because it is THEIR name that goes with that permanent artwork. If you have a crappy design and they tattoo it anyway, you tell your friends 'so-and-so from here did this' a reputation can be tarnished.\n \nSure, pricing is a bit high. It's Harvard Sq people. The same girl who just spend 50 bucks on a T-shirt from Urban Outfitters across the street is complaining? But some of these are artists who have 10+ years of experience, from all parts of the country! You should be so lucky you're not getting work done by a scratcher.\n\nOwen and Erin have been so amazing with every piercing and explains care instructions each time. Always willing to help me with jewelry. They are honest when they tell me a piercing won't work well on me. 'The webbing on your tongue is too long, it won't work, you've pierced your navel too many times, I won't recommend it' etc. Isn't that what you want in a great piercer? It is a very intimate experience. Filled with excitement, fear, pain and nervous giggles. And about going to the Jewelry Gallery, there are constructional restrictions why you need to buy your jewelry over there. Also a smart marketing tool. Making it impossible for you not to look at their selection of body jewelry. And when they tell you 'don't touch your piercing with dirty hands'  it means don't play with your damn piercing! They create an extremely sterile environment and each body reacts differently to a foreign object being forced into it. You must do your part and keep your filthy hands away from it! I've been pierced over 15 times here, not one has been infected. \n\nAs for the receptionist at the Chameleon and the Jewelry Gallery. Give them some motha' F'n slack. They have to answer the same questions over and over and over and over. Which is their job! But when a mother and a 15yr old daughter with no ID tag team the front desk workers and scream and make a huge scene, it tends to damper their day. I would say about 60% of their customers are rude snooty, arrogant, drunk, whiney, some underage, ignorant people. They do a fabulous job. And at the jewelry gallery, she is stuck and that DAMN glass coffin for 10 hours a day!!! 10 hours by yourself.  Tell me you won't get a little crazy.  So be nice first!\n\nThe people who are giving this place 2 stars or less, might not know all the priorities of a tattoo shop (not a PARLOR). I recommend going here for all your body modificatin needs, no facial tattoos it's illegal in MA. Bring proper ID government issued. 16 or under for a piercing must be accompanied by a legal guardian, be prepared  to provide documentation. 16 and under may not received  navel, oral, nipple, genital piercings due to MA law. So don't even ask. They will not pierce or tattoo you if you have been drinking. Alcohol thins the blood and makes you bleed more. Your tattoo will suffer.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you get it.",

                    "text": "There are two types of people in the world (well, three, if you count vegetarians, but we all know they're not really people): Those who eat steak, and those who eat hamburgers. I am definitely a hamburger type of girl, with the small requirement that it be a restaurant-style burger - it may not be steak, but you should still get to order it like one :)\n\nBobby's Burger Palace breaks a few rules of the restaurant-style burger, though. While you do get to choose how you want it cooked and the prices are indeed north of $6 (not exceedingly so, with the classic cheeseburger starting at $6.50), fries don't come with. And it's not a restaurant, it's a \"palace.\"\n\nYou kind of have to go to understand what I mean when I say it looks like a restaurant, feels like a bar and functions like a fast food joint. You start by ordering and paying at the register, but then after you seat yourself (after all the work is done, right?) someone suddenly shows up who looks like a server and acts like a server but is mostly just there for moral support, because if you try to order a beverage from this person, they will do something like give you an empty cup and direct you to the self-serve soda fountain. But they do bring you your food, based on the number placard you set on your table (and bus your plates away after you're done). The system might sound a little awkward, but it actually runs completely smoothly and efficiently as far as I can tell. It's probably somehow a profitable strategy, but for the unassuming customer it means no hassle of splitting the bill or paying tip.\n\nI've come on two occasions and on the first, I tried the L.A. Burger, which I thought was good but too salty (it's pretty heavily seasoned). The latter sentiment faded away as my taste buds readjusted so I was fully in burger heaven by the last few bites. The \"avocado relish\" is amazing and aptly named (it's sort of a pleasantly sweet, chunky guacamole), and I liked how instead of lettuce there were some sprigs of watercress. I also went all out on the sauces, which are in plastic squeeze bottles (the unmarked white vans of the condiment world) next to the salt and pepper shakers. I never took a bite without drizzling some chipotle ketchup or jalapeno hot sauce on it first. Because of this, the second time I went, I thought I could get away with getting the cheeseburger since I knew I'd be all about the sauces anyway. Bad idea, because the iceberg lettuce and onion were overpoweringly fresh (when have I ever complained about freshness?). I preferred the softer texture and more complex flavors of the L.A. rendition, which meshed better with the sauces.\n\nAs for drinks, I've ordered the frozen pear cactus margarita which is a complete steal at $4.50 because this thing is positively doused in alcohol, but that's about the only reason to feel good about getting it. It's the shade of peptol bismo, and tastes worse - like liquid salt. While \"pear cactus\" certainly sounds like an appealing flavor, all it did for the drink as far as I'm concerned is shock it into a color not occurring in nature, and make it \"spiked.\" I've also tried the vanilla milkshake, which unfortunately looks better than it tastes and is definitely overpriced at $5. I can see how their milkshakes might bring some boys to the yard, but I was unimpressed. I think they use real ice cream (with visible specks of vanilla!) which is commendable but as the texture is too thin it starts getting runny pretty fast... Such potential but when it comes down to it, a real wet blanket. I've had better milkshakes at Wa-wa and Wendy's! (But then again I really like those.)\n\nAs good as the burgers are, the big draw of Bobby's Burger Palace for me has to be the layout, which somehow feels both retro and contemporary, both refined and informal. Because the countertop-style tables are communal, it's more of a public space than most restaurants where you get your own isolated cove; it's kind of like a family-friendly bar or an indoor picnic area. (At peak hours, I'd recommend going with one or two friends max to find seats easily.) The Palace's appeal may be its novelty; it feels trendy and gourmet but not bougie. But it's also the kind of place that you can't go to too often without wearing it out. While I loved it the first time and would recommend it to the uninitiated (omnivores, anyway), I personally feel decreasingly enthusiastic about it with each visit - not because it has changed, but precisely because nothing has.",

                    "text": "Review note: This review is based only on their delivery service.  I have never seen the interior of this restaurant and I hope I never have to either.\n------------------------------\nI got home late last night in a pretty bad mood.  Fortunately, I had Top Chef to look forward to.  Unfortunately, I had nothing in the fridge!  Though there are several solid options for Asian delivery, I had sushi on Tuesday.  That left me fumbling through my menu stack and finally turning to the World Wide Web for a suggestion.  I decided early on I wanted wings and settled on Wawa after finding a site that gave it 3  1/2 out of 5 starts (based on 17 reviews).  Though I am always very apprehensive when it comes to delivered wings - I took a chance.  Well, this is what I got for trying something new:\n\nI ordered a wing basket (10 wings + wedge fries /$8.99) and a 20 oz sprite ($1.69) plus one extra thing of ranch ($.79). Why does a place like this nickel and dime their customers? I have no clue - it might be that they are trying to maximize each sale... I don't think they get a lot of repeat business.  In addition, I noticed a pre-tax surcharge of $1.99.  Again, this is nothing out of the ordinary for such an establishment, but something to take note of nonetheless.\n\nThe order was placed at 9:50 but they did not show up until well past 11:00.  I live about 2 miles from this place - so that kind of irked me.  I know it's good for them to be able to knock out all their customers at one time, but seriously - there should be limits.   However, the delivery driver showed up with a huge smile and a charming affect.  In fact, he might have been the nicest delivery person I have ever met.  He handed me a large bag, spun and sauntered down the hall.\n\nI put my food down, washed my hands and got some ... no... I got A LOT of extra paper towel.  When I eat wings - I always end up looking something like this: http://bit.ly/UVwV.  In any event, I plopped myself down on the couch and dug in.  From here on out everything was a total disaster.\n\nI'm fairly lenient with my standards for delivered food - but even that has its' limits.  The wings were fairly large in size...but I ordered them extra hot and extra crispy.  They failed on both fronts.  On site, I expect extra crispy to be just that.  When delivered, I'll settle for something with a mild crunch.  These were soggy.  To top it off, the sauce tasted like sugar injected Tabasco; whereby, the cook had taken the liberty of removing all traces of spice.  The fries were even worse.  They were definitely wedge fries...and looked like they had been soaked in a bucket of water before getting sent out.  Again, I don't ask for much - but these were just too soggy.  Wawa uses a package ranch - I think it was Ken's but I honestly don't remember.  The containers were pretty darn small - and given the $.79 surcharge, I expected more.  Given Wawa's other shortcomings, I was not really concerned with the ranch.\n\nSo after eating a handful of wings, I decided to pop the Sprite.  I looked in the bag and found it E-M-P-T-Y!!!  I know this chaps some people - but I actually think it's a forgivable offense (if you want an unforgivable offense - go look at my review of No-Star Pizza - aka All-Star).  I am sympathetic to f*ups; what I expect in return is responsive service.  I finished my dinner and called WaWa.  The guy picked up the phone, asked me to hold, and there I sat for 2m45s.  I was pretty sure they had forgotten me - so I hung up and tried again.  Same thing - only this time - I sat for 4+ minutes.  Okay, third time is a charm? Not for me!  I tried a third time, and sat another 3 minutes before giving up.  Instead, I contacted the site I had ordered through and they emailed me back saying they had refunded the charge.\n\nI did not expect or want Wawa to run another drink out to me - but there is no way in hell that this place was so busy I needed to spend anywhere close to 3 minutes, let alone 10 minutes, on hold.  With all the other mediocre wing delivery spots in town - I do not see much of a reason to return.  The drink incident aside, the food is blah, but par for the course.  It's pretty reasonable - so that's a plus.",

                    "text": "Why is it that things are never as good as you remember them to be from years ago. What happens? Do you build up the memories to be something better than the actual experience... better than anything could ever be? Is it how one hangs on to youthful nostalgia, the sentimentality of which must be preserved by not allowing the present to overshadow the treasured past? Are memories real or are they dreams that are only based on experiences from the past? Are you ever going to talk about the frickin' restaurant?\n\nI first visited Bub's sometime in 1982 while on tour with a traveling rock band who were to play The Rusty Nail in Sunderland. They were a handful, and my job was to keep them on stage at night and out of jail by day. The band leader - no stranger to the road life and apparently no stranger to Bub's - actually got up before it was dark out, pounded on my motel door, and demanded that we all jump in the van and go to Bub's. In those days, if any of those guys got up before dark, they were seriously motivated. Such serious motivation was strictly reserved for acquisition or consumption of drugs, alcohol, and young girls and various combinations or permutations of the three. I was not looking forward to meeting Bub.\n\nAs I remember it, we rolled up to a corrugated tin shack in the middle of the woods. It had no windows, no sign, and smoke was billowing out of a vent in the roof. There was a door on each end of this long narrow building. I was afraid.\n\nWe walked in, and were met with an intoxicating waft of hickory smoke. There was a long row of serving tables and cauldrons stretching the length of the building. You grabbed a plate and a fork, walked through the room and pointed at what you wanted and it was tossed on to your plate. When you got to the end of the building, you pulled a beer from an icy washtub, you paid cash, and you went out the door and sat at a picnic table.\n\nI don't remember what I had. All that I do remember, beyond the previously related tale of how I came to be there, and my dim recollection of the structure, is that for the last 28 years, whenever someone would talk about this barbecue joint or that one, I'd get this strange feeling. I'd say \"Bub's,\" and then my mind would just drift away. I did know, somehow, that whatever I had there that day had been great.\n\n\"Bub's?,\" they'd say.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I 'd answer, \"it was some shack out in the middle of the woods in western Massachusetts.\n\n\"Never heard of it.\"\n\n\"I dunno, it's probably not there any more. Man. It was awesome.\"\n\nSometimes, I'd think I must have dreamed it up. All I could really remember was how good it was. in a shack. in the woods.\n\nFlash forward, 28 years... driving down Route 9 in Hadley with my newly-relocated-to-out-there GF, and as I cross Route 116 I see a sign pointing north. \"Bub's Barbecue - 4 miles.\" Huh? What? No way! I realize that we are actually near Sunderland... it must be the place. We careen up the road, my mouth watering. I had the pulled pork sandwich that day. Went back this past Sunday and had the brisket sandwich.\n\nI'm here to tell you that sometimes you CAN go home. Sometimes, things ARE as good as you remembered. In fact, some times, they're better.\n\nFor less than $10 you can get a pulled pork or brisket sandwich with a bottomless cup of soda, and the \"hot and cold buffet.\" For a few more bucks you can get a slab of ribs. Pulled pork - excellent. Brisket - awesome. Buffet - unbelievably great: french fries, hickory smoked roast potatoes, sweet potatoes, collard greens, barbecued beans, dirty rice, roast chicken and vegetable soup, Cole slaw, potato salad, pasta salad, pickled beets, corn salad, and I forget what else... The french fries, dirty rice, collard greens and smoked potatoes are particularly noteworthy. I don't want to give Bub any ideas, but a sandwich with one side and Cole slaw would be a pretty good deal anywhere.\n\nI don't know if there ever really was a windowless tin shack.\n\nI don't know if Route 116 used to be out in the woods.\n\nSeems the young folks out here never heard of a place called \"The Rusty Nail.\"\n\nAnd I still don't know what I ate that day some 28 years ago.\n\nBut, I do know that whatever it was, wherever it was, however it was all those years ago, what I had at Bub's the day before yesterday did not let me and my memories down at all.\n\nWhen does that happen in real life? Really.\n\nI guess I'll have to go back again soon to make sure Bub's is really there. I might as well have the ribs while I'm checking.",

Raves about the brunch all brought us here.\nWalking in 12 minutes too late after the set brunch seating time at a \"busy\" brunch time. Okay... not so cool on our part. EXCEPT our friend was there on time .. waiting.. right next to empty tables AND a whole back area of empty tables/booths. The host knows all about us when we walk in.. friend lets us know our only exhausting option is to sit at the bar. No problem.. let's just do this. We are actually happy to see that we will be sitting at the closed off section for our little group. Served warm but fresh squeezed OJ.. told bout how to proceed the buffet line. This \"line\" is Debbie Downer + 54x suicidal. It extends between tables where you can hover over families of 6 shoving their face and a banquet staring right at you. The setup is a counter infront of a open kitchen. Ooohh.. hot and piping food right? Too bad it;s so high I can;t see what i'm piling on my 60 pound porcelain plate. Wrists hurt and the ladies behind us won;t stop reading the labeled dishes 3 steps infront of them. Stop announcing \"chinese noodle salad\" .. I can read too.  Anyways we decide the easiest way to do this is to get a bit of everything now. None of that.. let;s start light and move on to the heavy or savory later. Time for the beast of plating high to unleash.. get it now before you have to go through hell again.\n\nWe sit... food is good. Meat fest. Everyone has their picks of what we would stand on line to get again. Mine are the arugula/mixed fancy green salad, asparagus eggs, some salmon and maybe some more flank steak to use some $23 brunch money points on. We don;t end up going back for seconds. Dessert table by the door is all loser looking when we get there. Three empty stacks of nothing... flan had about 2 pieces left... only fruit they had were 3 pieces of broken watermelon slices.. messy... not cool.. that's the only OTHER table they have.. should be kept looking somewhat decent.\n\nGuess what threw us off to really believe we had it coming to us when we stepped on an ant in 4th grade was when my friend spoke up outloud. This extremely normal well dressed with designer glasses man was changing his kid's diaper in the booth behind us. The audacity! Mind you.. by this time another family was punished to sit at the bar with us.. and we are all just eating calmly when this brute does this. This was a toddler being changed. Not even an infant with liquid squirt poop. He wasn;t just quickly packing up things either.. I mean he was all spread out with wiping action and fecal matter spreading everywhere. So by us speaking up.. we get a screaming reaction of curses and insults thrown at us. When we blatantly told a staff member behind the bar who could've been a manager.. she ducked her head, put her finger over her mouth and whispered \"I know\" without making eye contact with us.. and then disappeared. This guy when exiting our what it felt like torture dungeon,.. decided to come next to our ears and curse at us again for being \"an effing a-hole\". Anybody to escort or regulate on this guy around? Nope. All up to 3 girls and 1 guy customer to deal with this. Best part was when nobody from the restaurant acknowledged any of this and left us feeling like criminals when we were just defending someone who was to sit there next. The same lady who said \"I know\" came by.. to what I thought was going to check on the booth.. but instead went into a back room to do something else. Sweet. \nWhat I am getting at .. not being a drama queen.. is that this could have all been perhaps avoided if the empty seats were filled with our awesome human presence instead. Like they should have let us done. See you never Blue Room Brunch.",

                    "text": "Why do we dine out? Everyone has a reason, whether it be a special occasion, a lack of love in the cooking department, or perhaps a feeling of duty to one's palate to experiment and delight one's senses.\n\nI find that when dining out, the best possible scenario would be to have ambiance, an engaging staff, interesting menu options, clean tastes, lovely presentation, and a general memory-worthy experience. I enjoy food because it takes me somewhere that I remember fondly or creates a new place in my mind that I can tuck into the \"lovely memory section\" of this foodie brain. Now, while this blog isn't a restaurant guide to California's Central Coast, the fact that I woke up this morning still talking about our meal last night begged for a blog expos\u00e9. I need to channel it somewhere, my husband and I have usurped all of our verbal accolades one could fathom, and my parents won't answer the phone. So here I go.\n\nLast night was our first anniversary. Well, not true entirely...it was last week, actually, but we have stretched the celebration out for one week. I recommend that. Quite nice. As our first date was in a velvet-curtained alcove at Robin's in Cambria, we thought it would be appropriate to spend our first anniversary at a sister restaurant of Robin's: Luna Red in San Luis Obispo. It was the grandest dining experience I can remember.\n\nUpon entering was a warmly lit, red-walled, bistro style restaurant. Candlelight, stylish staff, full wine bar, and lush conversation lining the walls. We sat in the back room by the fireplace and were greeted by a most engaging, professional server who made us feel as though he had been expecting us and looking forward to our visit.\n\nThe wine list had at least three of our favorite reds; the tea menu was fragrant with experimentation and unique flavors. But the menu. The menu. Art. Tapas of the spicy, raw, fresh, crispy, hot and fire variety. In-house, cured meats and olives, flavor combinations that require salivation, and an emphasis on the local. The chef is an artist. I couldn't focus on order; my eyes kept jumping from entree to salad to spicy tapas until through my glassy eyed menu coma I heard Rory say, \"You haven't even seen the back of the menu, have you?!\" Deep breath. Cheese menu! Yes, on the back of this artfully luscious menu was a cheese page. Well, cheese and salumi, actually. House-created salumis. Salt-cured and spicy, and even for this not so meaty girl, I could taste the peppery, smoked aromas and just imagine the care with which they were produced. The cheeses were listed from fresh to blooming soft (where my absolute favorite cheese appeared-Humboldt Fog), to semi firm to firm and a jubilant leap to blue. The pairings were beautiful, clean and simple. Our pungent Red Hawk was spotlighted by thinly sliced, tart green apples, candied walnuts and a drizzle of honey. A simple presentation done perfectly. Perfectly!\n\nWhen we eat out, we enjoy sharing plates and tasting lots of things, so the Tapas menu really suited us well. We ordered sashimi, which was presented with a mustardy wasabi, a really beautiful ginger bloom, juicy mandarin, kimchee and thinly sliced cucumbers. Careful. Clean. Cold.\n\nNext was the steamers bowl. Crostini, mussels and clams steamed in a chunky garlic broth of mustard, lemon, butter and white wine. Salty, flavorful, and bread-soakingly beautiful.\n\nThe Prawns Adobo followed suit with a parade of spicy. Rory is still talking about this one. Coconut buttermilk paired with a siracha style pepper sauce, succulent prawns, and topped with shoestring potatoes. This was prepared so well, and was presented in a deep bowl with a large spoon. We took JOY in eating this, and I can still taste the spicy and sweet broth. Mmmmmm.\n\nEspresso to follow, with a shred of lemon peel and a really rich cleansing of our palates. Such a great dinner. The service was just exceptional, a darker restaurant lit well with just candles and pleased people. Sometimes when I eat something, it takes me back to a place where I felt an emotion so special or noteworthy that the re-creation of that feeling just makes me so grateful. Last night's meal was that-a blending of my travels, of my independence, my childhood comfort foods, my new adventures of taste with my husband, and freshly created memories.\n\nWe ended with dessert-a banana, pecan bread pudding topped with an airy, coconut ice cream and a buttery, caramel rum sauce. It was warm, decadent, and the epitome of what a bread pudding, and the final taste of a great restaurant experience should be. I cannot wait to dine there with the people that I love and make new memories, and I am so thankful to have savored our first anniversary in such a romantic, magical gem.",

                    "text": "OK, it hurts like hell to write this review.  Very painful, i am still in shock.  This used to be my SPOT.  Used to have at least one meal here a day. This restaurant is down the street from my house, on my way to the subway, i would pick something up, on my way home either grab take out dinner or dine in and enjoy the African music.  Me and my girls would meet here after work and grab dinner, chat, have our business.daydreaming meetings.  \n\nNow, service is slow and they normally have only 1 or maybe 2 on a weekend night and during brunch.  If i order take out, ill order the food, do a few errands, come back to pick up my food, if i am dining in, i go about an hour before am really starving.  It can also get a little cramped.  menu can used some new additions, but i was willing to deal with these issues, because i love the food, vibe and just wanted to show my support.  \n\n\nOne Sunday, i went with my sister for brunch, i asked for a grilled chicken sandwich ( stuffed with French fries).  I told the dude i did not want the French fries in my sandwich tho.  He came back with a grilled freaking LAMB ( with the fries in the sandwich), so he not only got my order wrong, he did not listen.  They bought me another sandwich just as i requested.  Ate and it was yummy.\n\nWent back there 2 weekends later with my sister, same thing happened, asked for a grilled chicken with my French fries out ( not in the sandwich).  He came back with GRILLED LAMB again, but this time, my French fries were not stuffed in the sandwich ( he listened to that part).  I asked my sister if i said Lamb, she said no. I know i did not say lamb, because I don't eat lamb, i don't eat red meat and lamb is just not in my vocab let alone my dietary vocab.  He apologized and they made me another sandwich but gave me the cold French fries from earlier.  I wanted to cry, at this point I was STARVING. I know, if you are hungry, u should eat anything but damnnnnn.  Anyway, they made me a fresh new batch of French fries and I was happy.\n\nDuring the week, i still stopped by to grab my morning pastries etc. The staff always greet because they remember you and it is just a nice neighborhood restaurant.\n\nSo this is where my story gets worse, went with my good friend on a really busy Friday night ( too lazy too cook again), i ordered a grilled lemon chicken  with white rice and plantains ( my fav dinner meal here) with the Jamaica hot peppers sauce and my onion sauce in the side.  So i start eating, enjoying every single bite, chatting away with my friend.  Next thing got  closer to the bottom of my dish,  i noticed a black line on the white plate, now i thought it was a crack in the white plate.  Something told me to check it out properly, used my fork and the line moved, GRRRRHHHHHHH, it was freaking hair ( my worst nightmare), i wanted to throw up. Not 1 strand but 2 strands in the bottom of the plate, WTF.  It was not my hair, cause my hair is curly ( natural not relaxed), plus i had a head tie and a hat on.  So, this was not possible, plus it was in the bottom of the plate.\n\nNow, i tried not to make a scene, because they were busy, didn't want others to be grossed out, plus i am a regular here.  i called the waitress over quietly  ( who usually serves me during dinner, really sweet girl).  I showed her and she apologized and called the manager over.  He said maybe it is your hair, i looked at him thinking dude i have a winter hat on, plus a scarf underneath the hat.  He was apologetic, oh u have a hat on.  He apologized and offered me another meal, tea, coffee, desert and i said No, am fine it is really OK, shit does happen and they were apologetic.  \n\nSo we sat for another 3 minutes and decided to get the bill,  These fools charged us for my meal but gave a 15 percent discount.  I called the manager over and asked why would they charge me, when i found hair in my food, he was like oh but we offered you something else.  I told him i understood that but i did not finish my meal cos i found hair in it, he told me he has a business to run.  I told him, dude I come here almost everyday.  He was like i know, i see you all the time and am like OK so clearly i am a returning customer.  He was like well i have a business to run.  Am like i don't think should pay for my meal, the drinks yes, my friends meal yes, but not my food with hair, absolutely not.  He grabbed the bill, went to the register, came back and placed the check on the table and walked away.  We finally only paid for the drinks and my friends meal.  I could not believe this is how they treated regulars.\n\nAnyway, i do miss the food and vibe . He had the nerves to say we are giving you 15% off the tab, I have a business to run, major WTF.  \n\nI walk by there and it hurts not to go in to order anything.  I know i should get over it, but it a matter of principle.",

We foster and promote the arts and fashion via art shows, stocking work from local artisans/designers, photographers and jewelry makers.\n\nI'm not sure whether people aware of the fact that Moksha introduced MANY (at one time: small/unknown/start-up) brands to Seattle such as Insight 51, WESC, GRN Apple Tree, Brownsound, Gentle Fawn, The People Have Spoken, Industry and dare I go on? It was always a treat when the buyers of other nameless locations would browse through our racks. We don't see those folks much anymore and we also don't carry most of those brands and I'm sure you can only guess why.\n\nMoksha is where your friends work, shop and play. EVERY SINGLE ITEM is hand selected and not sought after because the lastest DNR magazine said, \"this is what's HOT.\" As I like to say, we don't follow trends, we make them. Items range from $5 to $200. You can find your favorite spanish lipgloss for $5, search through the $10 bin where most items are marked at more than 90% off. Books from Upper Playground/FIFTY24SF artists: Jeremy Fish, Maya Hayuk & more are available for $22. You can ALWAYS find a handmade scarf from Thailand from about $8-12. T-shirts average about $28 for both men and women. Denim flies off the shelves around here but usually ranges from $60 to $90. Don't even get me started about the Thailand shipments! Cute cotton blouses, tank tops and dresses range from $15 to about $34 all of which, fly off the rack. Yes, some items are priced higher than others but that's because of the diverse selection. Did I mention Moksha now carries vintage shoes and sweaters???? I personally picked up three 70's euro styled sweaters for only $8 each.\n\nNow, I appreciate good, prompt service when I'm being waited on at restaurant but here at Moksha, we like to leave people to their own devices. I personally greet every single person who walks through the door on my shift and it's genuine. I'm sure you are all aware that most stores hire people to simply \"greet you.\" If you need to be hand held, told how to put an outfit together, what earrings look best on you- we are more than willing to assist you because after all, that's what we're here for but we don't know you need help because we are not mind readers- so just ask!\n\nAs for the exchange policy, we are more than willing to exchange your goods. If it is a regular marked item and you have all the original tags & receipts and is done within 14 days. (Sometimes we make exceptions, so be nice! Naturally we are also a little more lenient during the holidays.) For every reaction there is a reaction and if you wore the outfit the night before and it shows, no dice. We are not a major retailer and we are not able to send our unsold, returned items back to the companies from which they came... besides, major retailers get their items at rock bottom prices because they buy in bulk. So really, who's ripping who off? \n\nMoksha is where I shop. It's where my friends shop and I am always more than willing to share that secret with anyone who asks.",
