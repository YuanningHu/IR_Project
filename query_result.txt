Their chicken bokkeum is really good (get it spicy!), the soups are pretty good (galbi tang, soon doo bu tofu soup) and their rice bowls are fantastic (bibimbap and dolsot bibimbop in the stone bowl). The sauce is pretty spicy though, so if you normally don't like spicy, get it on the side. Actually, if you don't like spicy food don't get it at all; it's not the same without the sauce. The bulgogi (korean beef) actually isn't the greatest (even though so many say it's fantastic). It's a little too dry, and the marinade could be better. Everything else is really good though; definitely get the free soup (it's always pretty good) and the kimchi and sardines that come with every dish are really good too.

Again, not a main course, but a good veggie course with a group.\n\nDan Dan Noodles:  Good.  I liked this dish better than Mary Chung's.  Maybe MC was having a bad day when I was there.\n\nSichaun Wantons (or dumplings??) in Capsicum vinaigrette:  Very Good.  Spicy with great flavor.\n\nBraised Eggplant:  Very Good. Just finished the leftovers for lunch today.  Just as good the second day.\n\nSweet Potato Noodles with Ground Pork:  Very Good.  This is the well known Sichuan dish \"Ants Climb a Tree\".\n\nTwo Thumbs up.  Prices are decent.  I'm not sure I heard  any English spoken on my last trip (all Chinese.)  I will be checking out more of the Chinese menu.",
