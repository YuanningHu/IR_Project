Sometimes average has its place. A Pizza Mart has perhaps the most dependable pizza I've ever had. I suppose you could say that \"A Pizza Mart takes average to a new level\" or \"A Pizza Mart changes the way you think about 'average.'\" It's never bad, just like PBR is never bad, and A Pizza Mart's pies are certainly better quality and more consistent than the chains. There is a time for an average slice of pizza at an affordable price, and A Pizza Mart understands this. And next time I'm in the mood for a slice of cheese, a slice of veggie, or a full pie of my signature green pepper and pineapple pizza, someone ought to remind me to keep A Pizza Mart on my shortlist.",

This review is for the pizza at the former Adelphi location (which I'll imagine is virtually identical to that at the new location in College Park). The pizza is very tasty. I've eated at the chain Ledo's a couple times and will admit that the original location serves up pizza that's a bit better. The crust is \"flaky\", the sauce is a bit sweet and the cheese tastes \"marbelized\" (for lack of a better term). However, somehow the crust, sauce, and the cheese combine synergistically to form quite tasty pizza. It's obviously not Chicago Style or NY-style. I think it may resemble St. Louis-style pizza (use of multiple cheeses) and Detroit Style pizza (thicker crust with rectangular slices and pies), but I'm not sure. In spite of how much I've enjoyed the pizza at Ledo Restaurant, I personally feel that Continental Pizza in Kensington does a better job making \"Ledo-style\" pizza.",

I love pizza of all kinds, and I can tell you Defazio's makes excellent pizza.\n\nI would rather eat lint than not have a Defazio's pesto pizza.\n\nWhat makes Defazio's so good?  They make their dough fresh from scratch on premises: you can simply taste it.  The sauces, all made next door at the Defazio's deli, which has been around for decades - probably close to 50 years or more - are all made from the best ingredients the old-fashioned way.  And Rocky has a secret ingredient in the pesto sauce that, I think, gives it the perfect taste for pizza.  Ask him about it.\n\n20+ years ago when I tasted the pesto pizza for the first time I was in love, and it has been an enduring relationship.  Whenever I'm in Troy I make sure I stop by.  I sing love songs to my pizza when it arrives, and I weep tears of regret when I'm finished.  The other pizzas are good, too.\n\nThink I'm embellishing???? Try it.",

Again, bold talk, considering how many pizza places are located in and around Boston.  In the Cambridge area alone, we have dozens upon dozens of pizza joints, but they all seem to be interchangable with another. That's not necessarily a bad thing since many of those places put their own spin and flavor on an already delicious meal.  \n\nThat being said, Otto Pizza is probably the best pizza joint out here in the Boston area. Located right in Harvard Square, it is in a prime spot for college students, pizza lovers and anyone and everyone who is passing through the area, looking for a quick bite.  When looking at pizza in general, there are so many different styles, big New York style, thick-crusted Chicago style, flatbread, multi-squared Sicilian style.  Otto's pizza is your typical, large sliced New York style, which smells and looks just like your run of the mill slice.  Until you take a bite.  Its pizza that takes it back to basics. Fresh ingredients. Seasoned crusts. Crunchy and soft. But the one thing that was the most memorable - the sauce. Tasting like tomatoes massaged together, with hints of other spices, this was fantastic.  Its the basic ingredient in all pizzas, but Otto Pizza has taken the time and effort to create a delicious and utterly flavorful sauce. Combined with the bubbly cheese and pepperoni it was by far the best slice of pizza.  Served like any other slice, this place has kept it simple with their presentation, putting a hip yet grounded spin on the pizza. The sauce in pizza is the backbone and the foundation, combined with the crust and ingredients, it creates an experience.  In this case, Otto Pizza creates a minimal effort to present you with your pizza, but then floors you with the taste.  You will be pleasantly surprised.\n\nIf you find yourself in Harvard around lunch time, dinner or just need a quick snack, Otto Pizza is where you want to go.  Finding a solid ground between creativity and simplicity, this fares as one of the top pizza places in the Boston area.",

I know, lasagna pizza sounds gross but it was really good, it had ricotta and ground beef and sauce and it was yummy; both pizzas were. The pizzas were a lot smaller than we thought they would be, especially for the price. I would say it's a little expensive.

Every pizza is made to order, baked while you wait (usually about 3-5 minutes), and presented to you by a friendly server from behind the counter.\n\nThe final product leaves you feeling satisfied without the overly greasy or bloated sensations often associated with big-time fast food chain pizza.\n\nMOD is by far my new favorite pizza place to have lunch at on or near the Ave.  No more wasting time and money at Pagliacci, home of the soggy pizza and crabby service.\n\nHappy to have this business in the U-District - I will be back!",

I know of no other restaurant with pizza that looks or tastes like Al Forno's.  It may simply be the best pizza in the U.S.\n\nThe pizza is a perfect combination of a thin grilled pizza bread base, melted cheese, olive oil, tomato sauce, and some scallions.\n\nEach ingredient is also individually excellent.  The bread isn't heavy or overcooked.  The cheese isn't rubbery or overly chewy.  The tomato sauce isn't tart or too sweet. The olive oil drizzled on top adds to the pizza's overall flavor and isn't superfluous or simply decorative.  The scallion curls are added in just the right proportion to be very constructive to the tasty creation.\n\n Al Forno offers a unique tasty pizza that is a delight with every bite!",

Is it because I'm bad at building my own pizzas or because this place isn't that great?\n\nSome of these reviews are kind of misleading. A $6 gourmet pizza sounds great... but its $6 for just a plain margherita pizza (dough, tomato sauce, cheese). Once you start adding on the $1 / $3 toppings, you'll realize that you're probably paying more to customize your pizza than you would for a pizza at, say, CPK (which has a bunch of toppings at a set price and good recipes). \n\nThe last time I came, I got a margherita pizza ($6) with chicken ($1), tomatoes ($1), and sausage ($1). I thought the chicken would be chunks of chicken (like on a BBQ chicken pizza) but it was actually just shredded pieces of white meat. The pizza wasn't that bad but it tasted sooo bland. My friend's had more flavor but I think it's only because she got chili.  I know, I know there was a sign up that warns people that the pizza NOT crispy but deng that thing was soggy. \n\nIt wasn't really impressive but the concept is cool. I wouldn't wait in line for it but I would try it again. The best part is that they are open until 2am so it's perfect for drunchies after a night at brewco!",

I was feeling pizza and I had a Scoutmob deal, so why not?\n\nWe opted for the BBQ chicken and chicken sausage pizzas at $8.95 each. With the house salad the bf ordered, it came out to $12-something with the Scoutmob deal. WIN! \n\nI had been to the Northside Dr. Little Azio years ago and remembered how tasty the BBQ chicken pizza was, so I knew I wanted that. I was taking a chance on the chicken sausage pizza. \n\nWe waited for the pizzas. And waited. And waited... mind you, this was after a near-5 mile run for me, and I was ravenous. I kept eyeing other diners on the patio, and their food in particular. \n\nFinally, the BBQ chicken pizza came out. It did not disappoint. If anything, it might've had a little too much BBQ sauce, but the chicken, cilantro, red onion and cheese were great on the pizza. I ate my slices and kept looking back at the door to Little Azio for the food runner to come out with our second pizza.\n\nCue more waiting... \n\nHallelujah, the chicken sausage pizza arrived! Presentation-wise, it was not too impressive. The slices of sausage and mushrooms were few and far between and not evenly spread out. There were some slices that basically just had cheese on it. Speaking of cheese, this pizza had so much damn cheese. I love cheese, but it was just too much considering the pizza is thin crust to begin with. All I could taste when eating the pizza was cheese. No other flavor from the chicken sausage. I wouldn't get this one again.\n\nConsidering most of their 12\" pizzas are $8.95, I think that's a pretty good value considering one of those pizzas would last me a couple of meals. I would go here for the BBQ chicken pizza because it is just that good, but that's about it.",

It's a little bit too greasy for my taste, but nothing I can't dab away with a napkin.  For some reason this pizza is a good candidate for those weekend mornings when you wake up slightly tired and maybe hung-over, and you just want to eat some pizza.

The guy who came back seemed rushed and when we opened the pizza box, the pizza was already getting cold, and the ENTIRE pizza was squished over to one side of the box.  Can't say I'm a fan of cold and squished pizza.\n\nThat being said, this place is pretty good.",

There's table seating and stool countertop seating for eating in and plenty of potted plants (basil, thyme, mint) near the window.

See the menu at http://www.crispybasil.com\n\nI ordered 2 specialty pizza slices ($3 each with tax), which were reheated in the brick oven. I had a slice of Eggplant Parm (topped with breaded eggplant, ricotta cheese, parmesan, mozzarella, parsley, and marinara sauce) and a slice of Teriyaki Chicken (topped with teriyaki chicken breast pieces, green peppers, onions, mushrooms, pizza sauce, and mozzarella. The amount of toppings were generous on top of a thin crisp firm crust. I sampled the pizza slices which had were good and were filling, but the temperature of the pizza slices were lukewarm and not piping hot. Since I was in a rush, I packed up the half eaten pizza slices and reheated in the oven later on when I arrived home. IMO, PIZZA TASTES BETTER HOT!!!

The prices on their specials are reasonable. Where they really shine is their Sicilian slices. For some reason, people have decided that if a pizza is square then that means it's Sicilian style. Well they are wrong, super wrong. See, a Sicilian slice is about the spongy, crispy, soft and crunchy oxymoron of a pizza that is also a little (read 'perfectly') greasy. Crazy Dough's does Sicilian like it is supposed to be done. Yes, I have had Leones. It's good, but it's just square thick crust pizza.\nCrazy Dough's is where it's at for pizza in Harvard Square in my most humblest opinion :)",

I suppose if it was old, it really possible for the crust to A) start cracking, B) the crust tasting like cardboard, C) getting really soggy under the toppings.\n\nFresh Pizza\n\nAs you can't really ask for anything better, people usually standardize this type of pizza between what you would get from the chains and what you get at an authentic pizza place. I had the thai pizza and it definitely reminded me of eating a slice of banh mi....but thats just me. \n\nOverall\nAny pizza purists would believe that a great crust, from a fresh pizza, must be the main actor in the play between sauce, crust, cheese, and toppings. If your a pizza nazi and believe NY holds the true platonic ideal of what pizza is, than you may not necessarily be satisfied with this pizza. If its organic, fresh, and attempts to save mother earth, i may give it a star more because it makes my inner hippie proud.If you eat a slice, you probably won't be satisfied with it due to the nature of the crust being really thin in the first place. But if you want to try something new and interesting, i would definitely suggest you come her and try it out.",

I can't believe I didn't ever think of coming into this place as I'm in that plaza quiet often.\n\nParking:  Can park in their parking lot.  During business hours, you have to pay, but you can get it validated.  After business hours, that parking lot is free.  \n\nLocation:  Next to Einstein Bagels and Starbucks.  \n\nDecor:  It's small.  There's nothing really special about the decor.  I believe the main focus about this place is the food.\n\nService:  the people here are really friendly. \n\nFood:  The food is pretty cheap.  Each slice is about $3-4.  They have combo deals where you could get 2 pizzas and a drink for $8, which is worth it.  They sell everything from appetizers, salad, pasta, lasagna, calazones, new york pizza, chicago pizza, etc.  \n\nFood that we tried:\n\n**  Chicago Style:  The Meat Lover - Good; The Italian Veggie - My favorite! .  The Chicago pizza is good and I did like it, but I have tasted better. The pizza's aren't as tall as other places.  My husband and I thought that may be it would have tasted a little better if it was fresher.  We are definitely going to order the pizza in advance.  A whole Chicago Style Pizza takes about 45 minutes to make.  ** Chicago style pizza is my favorite here.  Also, my sister who lived in chicago for 3 months said that their pizza tasted exactly like the pizzas in chicago, which says a lot!\n\n** New York Style:  The White Pizza - Really good! My Dominic - Good. I'm not a huge new york style pizza fan, but it was good.  My husband really liked it! The slices are definitely really big.  \n\n** Note:\nThis place gets really really crowded! There are people who walk in very second.\n\nI will definitely be coming here more often!  I'm excited to try all the other foods!",

However, this location kind of sucks compared to the Carmel Mountain Ranch location, where the service is friendlier and faster. Yesterday I went to the La Jolla location with my friend and there was only one girl at the register (who also had to answer the phone and run the food), and one other woman making pizzas and the place was pretty crowded so we were warned that it would take 20-25 minutes for our pizzas (which it did). You'd think they could staff the place better during the lunch hour. While we were waiting to order, another patron brought her pizza up to the register to point out that she'd found a hair in her pizza. Lovely. Luckily my friend (who'd never been to a Z Pizza before) said her gluten-free crust was great. I had the Berkeley Vegan as a calzone and my only complaint is that they only give you a tiny little side of marinara to go with it. I will continue to go to Z Pizza but I would like to see this La Jolla location get their act together.",

The pizzas have a doughy crust and crumbs on the bottom (which I go back and forth about liking) but on the whole they are well made and always hit the spot.  A great place for a night out with friends and just as good for take out.  My go-to pizza in Shadyside any day.",

The key to this breed (or any kind of pizza really) is the crust which I felt was lacking in flavor.  The saving grace was the very nice server who was friendly and very attentive and the atmosphere was casual and relaxed.  If I were to include service in my ranking then this place should be a 3 star establishment.   Plus, its located in the U.

Two friends and I were in the food for pizza and the only place near his area of living was this small, locally owned restaurant. We got a large pepperoni pizza and it was very good. It wasn't greasy and it was very delicious. The pizza had an herbal taste to it--I can't quite put my finger on what it was, but it definitely wasn't just an ordinary pizza. I have also had the gyro pizza from here and it was really great. The breadsticks and garlic sticks are a great purchase too. They don't deliver, so I recommend getting a menu for future orders to it can be ready for pickup. On top of that, they are very fast when making your food. While normal places take about 15 to 20 minutes to make your pizza, this location said that it would only be around 7 minutes, and they were completely accurate. What they lack in delivery they make up for in timeliness. The restaurant is very unique and has a good location in Lafayette for what type of food establishment it is. If you browse through their menu, they have all types of specialty pizzas that I think would be really great to try. My friends are picky, so I didn't get to go that route.",

If this is the best pizza in LA then I live in the middle of 10 million absolute morons who either had their taste buds removed at birth, or who had their travel abilities severely limited.\n\nFor the past year at school, I've been wondering what pizza we were eating all the time at school events, with the big yellow \"NY Pizza\" on the box.  This pizza's crust was chewy, the toppings and cheese bland, and I generally referred to it as \"cardboard pizza\".  \n\nFast forward a year to today.  \n\nI had heard all kinds of great things about a place called Lamonica's, so today while walking around Westwood looking for dinner I decided to give it a try.  I walked in and saw a bunch of VERY old looking pizzas sitting in the window, and 1 fresh looking pepperoni pizza.  I asked for a slice of the pepperoni and as I was paying for it, I looked to my left and saw that dreaded box with the yellow \"NY Pizza\" printed on it.  Sh*t.\n\nI tried to pep myself up, telling myself that oh the pizza is just cold by the time it gets to school and the fresh stuff will be better.  \n\nTwo words: wishful thinking.\n\nSame crappy pizza.  Apparently not one of the 65 people who have previously reviewed this place has ever been to NYC and actually had a slice of that pizza.  NYC pizza is THIN CRUST, hello!  It has nothing in common with the chewy tasteless garbage coming out of Lamonica's ovens.  \n\nMaybe they could form a joint venture with Bubbalicious and make pizza-flavored chewing gum out of this stuff, because that's basically all it's good for.",

Their salads are awesome- their smallest size is more than enough to fill an empty stomach of an average sized 20-something year old person.  I'm not a big fan of their pasta dishes and I think their garlic bread is too greasy, so I'm going to just stick to their pizzas from now on.

There wasn't anything extraordinary about the sauce, cheese, dough or pepperoni.  What stood out most from my meal were my order of garlic knots.  They were absolutely undercooked, and right when I bit into them it was like I just ate a piece of warm dough.  Disgusting.  I took one bite of the five garlic knots that are served and didn't touch them for the rest of my meal.  The marinara sauce that accompanied them didn't help the cause much either.

It was also greasy, but that's probably because of the pepperoni.\n\nThe pizza was about $20. I understand why it's so expensive, but I think that I am happier getting pizza from a chain place and paying half that price. Their selection of beverages is not very good. It was $2 for a bottled water, but it was plenty to get me through my meal.\n\nThe atmosphere was good and bad. The ambiance was cool, but if I hadn't been one of the first people in line when they opened then I wouldn't have had a place to sit. It said on their website that they open at 11:30, but on Saturdays they actually open at noon. It's a good thing that I got there a half hour before they opened and was the fourth party in line. My pizza was ready probably 5 minutes after I ordered, so they are quick.\n\nI may go back at some point, and I'll make sure not to get pepperoni on my pizza next time!",

Well, because sometimes the pizza here is in-your-face-amazing and other times it can be kind of bad. \n\nLets start with the good. Cool factor; small little place in Harvard Square serving thier pizza new york style - meaning that it is pre-made and they pop it in the oven to warm up after you order. The pizza itself is Sicilian style, which I have a soft spot for since it reminds me of childhood. I haven't been to Galleria Umberto so I can't compare the two. When the pizza is good you get an amazing crunch from the crust and an insane chew from the soft part of the bread. The sauce half soaks into the crust to make the bread softer and enhances the flavor (one of the great advantages of the thick-crust pizza, though I may still prefer thin). Great flavor in the cheese, sauce, bread, and toppings.\n\nWhen its bad: The pizza can be lifeless. If the pizza has been sitting to long before you order, then you will get an extra crunchy piece with bad flavors. I haven't tried this, but I might ask for the 'freshest pizza' next time I go in; maybe I'll have to bump up my rating.\n\nBad experiences aside, the tomato basi pizza is great, the artichoke pizza is amazing, I love the pepperoni and I adore the sausage. Give it a try, maybe ask for what was just made. You won't (may) be dissapointed.",

However, I crave great pizza, pizza that will make me wiggle with happiness while I'm eating, pizza that is so delicious I want to shout about it from the rooftops.\n\nMy friends, Tarantino's pizza is that pizza.\n\nI stopped by here yesterday around 3pm for a very late lunch, since I had dinner reservations at 9pm and couldn't risk being felled by the hungries before then. I walked in and the checked tablecloths, sports-themed photographs (along with Spuds McKenzie!) on the wall, and the Dodger game playing on the kitchen's tv told me I was in for some man food. (Man food = no gorgonzola and ceviche on my pizza. THANK GOD.)\n\nCarlos brought me my menu and I ordered a Diet Coke (yay!) along with a small Caesar salad and a slice of pepperoni and fresh tomato. Both were huge! The Caesar dressing is excellent and homemade; you can definitely taste the anchovy, though it's not overwhelming at all. Unfortunately, the croutons are not homemade, which would bring the salad up a notch. (Yes, I hassled Carlos to tell me about everything I ate. I'm a bad-ass Yelper.)\n\nThe pizza...how to describe such wondrous flavors and textures? First of all, one slice covered the entire plate. Carlos said it was extra big just for me, no doubt because I'm so cute. It was piping hot and I had to control myself from gobbling it up immediately so as not to burn my mouth. I nibbled a bit of the crust and it was amazing, perfectly cooked and crisp.\n\nThere was an abundance of toppings, but not so much as to ruin the pizza. The sauce was so good I could eat it as soup. The cheese tasted fresh and the pepperoni put every place else's to shame. Best of all were the flavorful chunks of fresh tomato that had that delicious roasty taste they get from being in the oven. I had to work really hard to not finish the entire piece right there; I saved some for later because I didn't want to swell up and go into a pizza coma.\n\nI am never ordering delivery pizza again. Only the best for me from now on - Tarantino's.",

                    "text": "Years go by and things change...but one thing stays the same and that's my love for Enzo's pizza. \nMy honey and I have been occupying the corner table at Enzo's every Thursday night (more or less) for the past 3 years. If there's one place we can always count on it's Enzo's- Frank Sinatra singing in the background, Godfather pictures on the walls, red & white checked Italian tablecloths, candles, and fresh flowers at every table. Their pizza never disappoints. From their Pepperoni (when we used to eat meat), to their Veggie, to just a basic Cheese. It's always perfect. Their pizza by the slice is not as good as ordering a whole one, so if you have the time definitely wait it out for a fresh pie right out of the oven. The crust is perfectly crisp with a zesty pizza sauce topped off with warm, bubbly, melted cheese. I'm all about dipping my pizza in ranch and Enzo's has an amazing ranch dressing. Their house salad (w/cheese) is also a great starter. They also have calzones, subs, and pasta. The Baked Ziti is to-die-for...but be warned, it's a cheese overload and you'll have a tough time getting out of your chair afterwards. Pizza is all about personal preference, and for me Enzo's is where it's at. They've captured my heart...and more importantly my stomach....",

How can you go wrong with a hot, gooey, chocolate chip cookie straight out of the oven, with ice cream melting on the top of it???  (they have peanut butter, white chocolate macadamia, oreo and oatmeal raisin too) Even my mom's cookies growing up were never this amazing!  (Sorry mom!)\n\nThen it's all about the pizza.  The pizza is delectable.  I'm not normally a fan of deep-dish, but my palette makes an exception at BJ's.  I'm a big fan of their Blackened Chicken pizza with it's spicy chicken, creamy alfredo sauce and sweet corn to off-set the spice a bit but truly ANY pizza from BJ's is divine. \n\nIf you're STILL hungry... they have a great variety of salads, sandwiches, and baked potatoes filled with a ton of different toppings you'd normally find on your pizza... Seriously - the potatoes take up an entire plate!\n\nCan't forget to mention - BJ's is a brew house and has come up with some incredibly tasty beers and berry cider... for a real taste thrill - try mixing the RED with the berry cider... it is refreshing and makes a great companion to the rest of your meal.\n\nGreat food, friendly atmosphere, fairly priced.

It's just pizza after all.  But 800 Degrees comes pretty close: it's relatively cheap, a bit more than the price of Dominos, yet you get a lot more value for your money; the premium ingredients are sourced really well--from all over America and Italy; and you get to pick all of the ingredients you want for your personal pizza; most importantly, perhaps, the pizzas are done in about a MINUTE. \n\nThey have a burrata bar, great salads, beer & wine, and gelato from LA creamery, too.  Personally, I go with a margherita pizza with heirloom tomatoes, truffle cheese, bacon and pepperoni, baked CRISPY.  It's as good as it sounds.\n\nWestwood village just got a whole lot delicious-er.",

Pizzas were okay (I actually quite liked the crust), but the staff wasn't able to get pizzas out in time.  When there was a pizza out, it would be gone within a minute to two minutes.\n\nThe rest of the food was below average.  Salads were relatively fresh, but the soups were mediocre, ice cream was slightly watery, and the soda fountain was not fresh (Pepsi shouldn't be just carbonated water).\n\nThe atmosphere definitely feels like a dining hall.  Then again, this place is obviously targeting college students.  I'd only recommend this place to those looking for a lot of food and don't mind sacrificing the quality of food.  In my opinion, I think the money would be better spent in the Asian Ghetto right across the street.  You'd spend about the same money and get less food, but the quality of food would be many times better than Pepe's pizza.",

Their lasagna entree is actually quite good as well -- much better than you'd expect from a pizza joint.\n\nDon't go expecting atmosphere, though: Giovanni's, even after their recent remodeling, even makes Koronet look ghetto.

It's very good in terms of local college pizza. It's relatively cheap and it's about your average pizza size when it comes to small, medium, and large. They are open late and they are very patient with drunken students, at least they were the last time I went there with a group of friends. They have a thicker crust, which is nice, and it seems like their ingredients is a higher quality than the surrounding competition. I've had a friend who worked as a delivery person there and he said he really enjoyed working there. Marcos always donates and sponsors events around campus, so their support and involvement is something that is refreshing as well. If you are looking for some different pizza to try, I would highly recommend Marcos.",

With all the nostalgia associated with NYPD, I'm not sure if I can objectively rate the food at this place. \n\nHowever, I'm going to try.\n\nI've been going to NYPD as an end-of-evening refuge for about the last 10 years or so.  This is a pizza place like I remember from growing up in (gasp!) New Jersey, except those were usually named \"Mama's\", and Mama was usually making the pizza in the back.  NYPD is that kind of place withough Mama, and with an Ann Arbor twist.\n\nSo, let's start with the food... in my mind the most important thing about a pizza is the flavor.  A good slice should have substantial flavor, not be overpowered by cheese or sause.  A symphony of herbs and sauce and cheese and bread... THAT's pizza.  And while NYPD didn't measure up to the pizza napoli we tried in Naples, the Italians have been doing it for a while longer than NYPD, so we'll cut the locals some slack.  That being said, NYPD's 'zza has great flavor.\n\nOther than that, it can be a tad oily sometimes, but sometimes not.  That's what napkins are for.  \n\nThe atmosphere?  Pizza.  College pizza.  Including the rare drunk co-ed who wears a shorter-than-short mini skirt, drops one of the dollars she had clinched in her little fist, and then does a full straight-legged toe-touch to retrieve said dollar.  Let's say that this particular co-ed might've forgot to add a certain item of clothing before leaving home.\n\nHad to abandon my pizza that night - no more appetite. \n\nAnyhow, enough rambling.  NYPD is my fav pizza joint in town, and will always be a great stop.\n\nAnd, if you go in, say hi to Mary.  :)",

You can clearly indicate how toppings should be distributed on your pizza and pay for everything, including the delivery tip, online.  As for the pizza itself, the toppings are usually fresh-tasting, and the crust is so good.  It has a heartier flavor than most chain pizzas, and the thin-and-chewy factor is right on.\n\nOf the several orders we've placed in the past year (probably averages out to an order per month), this location has gotten our order wrong once. It's a decent record but still worth noting.  All in all, good service and a convenient dining option to have in these parts.\n\nI highly recommend tipping your delivery guys well...would YOU deliver pizzas in South LA?",

Craving some of that garlic butter dipping sauce, I felt it was worth it to order some carry out.\n\nSo I go online and try to remember my password, no avail.  So I try to get them to send me a new password.  The site says that a new password was sent, but I wait and wait and I don't receive one.  Eventually, I try to just call and place an order.  But the deals you can get online are not the same deals you can get online.  And when I call the location, the lady who answered the phone was most unhelpful.  With my heart set on a deal I found online, I create a new login.  Then I wait for the site to email me when I should go pick up the pie.  Again the waiting game leads to nothing.\n\nSo I after about twenty minutes of not receiving an email, I drive to the Papa John's.  I get there, tell them my name and pay for the pizza.  Then the lady who took my money started helping another lady enter stuff on the computer.  I give her my \"where's my pizza?\" look and she ignores me.  Apparently, the bulletproof glass separating us somehow made me disappear from her view.  Yes!!  Bulletproof glass at a Papa John's.  Apparently, downtown isn't so safe.\n\nAnyways, after she finishes helping the other lady she procedes to the back of the store.  To myself, I think, she must be getting my pizza.  Nope.  She beings making pizza.  Darn'it, I think, they haven't even made my pizza yet.  So I wait.  and I watch as she makes a pizza that doesn't look like anything I ordered.  Why is she putting on so much pepperoni!?  Where are the Olives I ordered?!  Ok, so maybe that isn't my pizza.  Oh, look, she's making anther one.  Maybe this one is my pizza?  Plain cheese?!  No, that can't be right.\n\nEventually, she looks my way I have giver her my most blatant \"Where the F is my pizza\" look.  (Ok, I never said anything.  Yes, I'm Asian.  Yes, I'm passive aggressive.  Deal with it.)  She looks at me blankly.  Puts and stops what she is doing.  We look at each other through the bullet proof glass.  Her, at the back of the store, me practically pressed against the glass trying to get her attention without jumping up and down.  \n\nShe finally moves to the front of the store to a rack of pizza boxes, grabs one of them and opens the bullet proof glass door and hands me a pizza.  A pizza that was sitting there before I even get to the store.  I pizza that has gone luke warm.  I pizza that is not longer the steaming pile of cheese and toppings that I longed for.  A pizza I had to wait and extra 15 minutes for not reason.  She almost looks like she's going to say \"Sorry for the wait.\"  But she says nothing.\n\nI drive home with my luke warm pizza.  Microwave heat is not the same as oven heat.  \n\nThis place was going to get one star, but I gave it two because, Damn that Garlic Dipping Sauce was good.  Oh, and at least they got the order right, except I asked for 8 pepper packets, not 5 and 3 cheese packets.  They got it sorta right.",

But what really makes me want to give it all five stars are their burgers and pizza (at least the vegan pizza with cashew cheese). Not bad for the price - $15 and can be split by two and utterly delicious. Though neither of us are vegan, we both agreed that it was the best pizza we had had. The pizza was thin, but had a fluffy outer crust. Best of both worlds.\n\nI've also had their burger, which I highly recommend. Perfectly cooked with a delectable sauce. I highly recommend this restaurant and I will continue to come back and try their dishes!",

I went with pepperoni\nIt was a fantastic deal really. In 20 minutes, I went out to pick up the pizza and brought it home to try for the first time. \n\nThe pizza actually tastes pretty fine, but my one gripe is how greasy it is. I guess that's how they achieve the crunchy crust and it does have great texture, but the greasiness can get overwhelming after a few bites. Actually, the oil is itself a flavor of the pizza it seems. The way I figured around it was to put a piece of paper towel on the bottom and let the paper towel soak it up. \nYou have an opportunity to be friendly to the environment by reusing by squeezing out  said oil from the paper towels and pan frying other items in your refrigerator. I suggest eggs. \n\nFor my small pizza, I got anchovies on them. Now I've never tried that before, so here's where I don't know whether it's a matter of custom or Jet's, but I got about one anchovy each slice. I don't know if that's how it's suppose to be, or Jet's might have been a little skimpy on it. All I can say is that I felt like I was just eating cheese pizza and at one point, it turns into an anchovy pizza and vanishes soon after. \n\nDespite these things, finished the entire pizza over the course of a few days. Would I go back? I suppose if I have that particular craving for the crust. This is definitely not a place to avoid. It's worth a try. :)",

With that said, I must reiterate that, like most Americans, I've had my fair share of pizza, and Pizza house is definitely the best pizza ever.\n\nThis is the only place I've ever been to where I can say for certain that everything on the menu is good. Of course there are things that I'm never going to like, but that's just my personal taste. However, chances are if you're a fan of something on the menu, you're going to love it.\n\nAnother reason I like this place is because they have so much to choose from. Don't feel like a pizza? Don't fret, because you can get sandwiches, subs, burgers, salads, paninis, and various appetizers. Take you're pick.\n\nCan this place get any better? Do you see the five stars?! This place delivers too! If you're not in the mood to go to their newly renovated restaurant (which has large flatscreens everywhere), you can just have them bring it to you. That's the American way!\n\nWhen I get back from Chicago, where their style might be more authentic, I'll edit this review and see if Pizza House lives up to its name as a Chicago pizzeria.",

Yes, at times the center is a bit soggy from the amazing ingredients used on top of the pizza, but that can really be forgiven, in my mind, when the balance of the crust is this good and the ingredients are this awesome. I do often worry about writing reviews that are too glowing, as it may build up the experience too much for some people and lead to disappointment.

The Rialto Giant (28 inches, 49 slices) is too big to fit in my front door, but if you're having people over for a game or a party it's perfect. Tip: Use it as an incentive on moving day. You'll have more help (and more pizza) than you'll know what to do with.\n\n4. An admirable selection of decently-priced beer means not having to make two stops on the way home.\n\n5.

How could your resist Jim Morrison??\n\nIt smelled amazing right when i walked in! I ordered a slice of cheese pizza. It was one of the best and simply delicious slice of cheese pizza I've ever had. It definitely hit the spot on that cold and rainy day in Berkeley.\n\nI definitely recommend it to anyone in the Berkeley area. The surrounding area of Fat Slice is also amazing with lots of eclectic shops & restaurants to choose from.",

It's pretty good with ham, but I like the sauce without the meat in it, so ever since then I've ordered it without the ham and it tastes just as good.  The sauce is a little spicy, but it adds that little zing to your palette.  The pasta comes with two slices of garlic bread and that is delicious with the vodka sauce.\n\nNot a big fan of pasta but like the lasagna taste?  The deep dish meat lover pizza tastes like a lasagna but with pizza dough in between the meat layers instead of pasta.  The pizza dough is really good.

It is so hard to find decent pizza in Ann Arbor. \n\nI have to start off with my personal pizza philosophy. Anyone can throw a bunch of meat or veggies on some dough overloaded with cheese and call it pizza, but if they can make a good pizza with minimal toppings, then they are awesome in my book. \n\nMani makes a good pizza. I love their margherita pizza. I have a hard time ordering anything else, and sometimes I crave their pizza and wish I could get it delivered. I've also enjoyed the tarfuto pizza. The egg and truffles are a cool textural combination. \n\nIf you're in the mood for small plates, the antipasti are typically great. The pickled tomatoes are super fun and unique. The calamari and artichokes are also good. I've also had some kind of seasonal seafood and enjoyed it. \n\nI've also heard great things about the pasta, but I haven't tried it myself. \n\nMani gets crowded, so be prepared for a wait for dinner. If you are in the mood to sit at the bar by the kitchen, it's fun to watch the food prepared. \n\nThe wait staff tends to take your order in waves (order your entree after you finish your appetizers), so if you don't have unlimited time, be sure to make a point to order all of your food right away. \n\nI would have given them five stars, but they are a little bit expensive. The bill can add up quickly if you want to try a few things (and you should).",

After starting a thread in the Yelp Atlanta \"Talk\" asking for the thinnest crust in the city, I was surprised that the majority suggested Domino's. I promised myself that I would not order from this establishment again, and I'll admit a shred of my dignity was lost when I logged on to their website.\n\nAnyways, that was a few months ago. I've secretly ordered from here at least 8-10 times since. The service is still hit-or-miss, but the pizza is not. It's perfect. I'm pretty specific when it comes to my perfect pizza: super thin crust with a little crisp to it, extra sauce, just a sprinkle of cheese, and a mountain of veggies. Domino's is the only place that gets it right every time. I owe it partly to their website, which is definitely the best online ordering experience I've ever had. They also let me select the heavy-on-the-topping option without charging extra. Every other pizza place I've ordered from has said they'd charge for each topping you'd like to go heavy on. \n\n75% of the time, the pizza is here in about 30 minutes. However, I have had a few instances where it didn't arrive for TWO HOURS, and this was after quite a few phone calls in which employees shouted at each other in the background, hung up on me, and called back saying  they thought the pizza was delivered but it's still on the counter. Once, when it finally did show up, the driver called me and asked if I could come downstairs from my highrise and cross the street to find his car. Worst of all, the few times this has happened, I've never been comped or offered a freebie in the future. My rating is definitely based more on the awesomeness of the thin crust American Legends veggie pizza and their website rather than the service. Consider yourself warned!\n\nForget the \"char\", the mozzarella di bufala, the San Marzano tomatoes, and the accompanying pretentiousness of gourmet pizza joints. Domino's hits the spot (it just may take awhile to get there...).",

I love everything about their pizza and wait don't forget about their salad bar! \n\nTo be honest I have really enjoyed this place for about 7 years now. I don't go many times throughout the year, but when I do I GET DOWN. On salad and pizza that is! Their salad bar is always fresh and has every topping imaginable. Even toppings that I don't think people normally put on their salad, but whatever. Now on to the pizza. I love the alfredo pizza. Alfredo, alfredo, alfredo. My 3 year old loves the hawaiian pizza and he never eats more than 1 slice, but here he eats nearly 3. Anyways, a lot of their pizzas are pretty good so I usually get a variety. My kids love the mac and some of their other pasta dishes, but I don't care to even try them. The baked potato station is always poppin too. I mean I've never had one, but when someone in my group gets one I always want one, but am too full by then to try one. :/ For being a buffet, they hav got the pizza down. Desert is yummy too. I love apple crisp and ice cream...together. The kids love the cinnamon rolls and mini donuts. I mean they get to eat all the crap they want, so of course they do! (coming from a mom who buys mostly organic, & no foods with artificial coloring) \n\nAnyways on to the arcade. I really like Johns because they really took the time to cater to all ages. There is something fun and exciting for everyone! Plus, my toddlers (2 & 3) get to run around crazy and I can't get mad at them. \n\nI probably won't be back to this place for a few months, but when I do, please believe I will probably eat way too much and then feel guilty for the next week, drinking homemade smoothies and working out non- stop.",

As much as I love Philly significantly more than New York, and think Philly is a bastion of high food culture whereas New York is a sinkhole of overpriced junk, New York does Pizza better than Philly, and New Haven, CT absolutely owns Philly.  So the bar is set lower.\n\nThis is one of the better pizza places I've found in Philly, but compared against the other non-pizza restaurants in the surrounding neighborhood, many of which earn their five stars, this one falls short.\n\nIt's very good, but the pizza just isn't as good as it could be.  Every time I sink my teeth into a slice of pizza here, I am heartily satisfied.  The ingredients are fresh, it's not too greasy...but...it just doesn't wow me.  It isn't an otherworldy experience.  And...in the Philly metro, up the road in the north 'burbs, is Jules Thin Crust, which costs only a bit more per slice, and does wow me like this.  And...up in New York and New Haven, CT, there are lots of places that look superficially like this one, but also wow me like that.  I need that experience of awesomeness before I dole out the fifth star.\n\nOther things that this place has going for it though are a great beer selection, really great location, a friendly staff, and the fact it's open late at night.\n\nThis place will make you say \"heck yeah\" when you are hungry and want a place to get good pizza and beer, but it won't knock your socks off if you're looking for the best gourmet pizza around.",

An additional hour is only one dollar, so no pain at all.\n\nI love this place, and I come almost every week. If you want a quick lunch, you can get a two slices + drink for ~$9 in an informal place with friendly staff and sports is always on the TV for a nice distraction. There are plenty of slices ready to reheat a la Sbarro's for quick delivery, and it tastes nice and fresh. \n\nFor dinner, you have some great specialty pizzas to choose from. My favorites are the Regents Signature, which has a nice clean taste with its jalapenos and artichoke hearts. It's a nice deviation from the classical toppings; And the Party, which is a more traditional combination pizza.\n\nOverall, a great relaxed place that serves pizza much higher quality than the place puts on. I like to think it's their mentality of putting their pizza first, much like the great pizza places in New York.\n\nTry it and you'll come again and again!",

I also feel like the oil content is just enough to make the pizza taste good but not to the point that I feel guilty for clogging up my arteries. \nI heard that the pizzas on sale by the slice rotate whenever they run out, so I'm hoping to see other toppings the next time I drop by. The crowds seem to go in waves at this place--sometimes I see a lot of people eating/waiting to get their pizza, and sometimes the place is empty. But the waves come and go quickly, I don't believe you ever have to wait too long. \nLike other reviews, don't really expect to find seating here. It's basically just a storefront. I think there are a few chairs inside facing the street but I don't know if people even bother sitting. I like grabbing it to go and eating it on the walk back to school.",

I could be wrong-maybe shitake and portabello mushrooms look identical...and maybe oyster and crimini look exactly the same with no distinguishing differences between them.\n\nThat is a big stretch though, so I will just say this thing should be called \"deux mushroom pizza\".  Geeze-I would still order it even if it was advertised only 2 types of mushrooms.  Most places only have one type.  Geeze.  Stop being stingy, pizza gourmet!\n\nThe pizza tastes like rubbery parmesean...just a hint of blue cheese, and only a taste of whatever sparse topping you bite into.  There was no flavor of truffle oil, or mushrooms in general-huge let down.  I was actually afraid it might have too strong a mushroom taste but it definately did not.\n\n\n\n\"Gourmet\" is a joke...there was a smidge of parsley on my pizza. not enough to make a difference.  The toppings are ridiculously under portioned.\n\nMy pizza was ice cold...I took it home and heated it up.so maybe that affected the crust, but when I ate a slice luke warm on my way home, it was hard and chewy.\n\nWhen I heated it up at home, it was soft, but still chewy.\n\nI was pretty pissed that my pizza was \"dry\"-as in, no sauce.  I was really expecting the pomodoro sauce underneath the gorgonzola cheese....\nif you aren't gonna put sauce, at least put more than one cut up tomato on a large pizza that I just paid 21 bucks for.  Seriously.\n\n\n\nI give this place 2 stars because it is not the worst pizza I've had...it certainly is better than tommys and fellini's...so, it deserves more than one star for that reason.\ni give this place a second star because even though there was a pitiful amount of toppings on this pizza, they were pretty good.\n\nFew things beat cooked veggies on a pizza...They cooked the onions, mushroom and the garlic, while adding fresh tomato.\n\nAlbeit, the pizza in general was disgusting, I really think it was the pizza maker's fault.\n\nSo maybe I'll come back, order a different pie, and do it on a different day, at a different shift....and hopefully it will not be burned on some parts like this one way.\n\nI hate the over powering flavor that a charred crust adds to the pizza.\n\nAlso, there is nowhere to sit down in this place...well, there are 4 flimsy looking stools...I wouldn't trust them to support more than 60 pounds of weight though.",

At first I was nervous that they would add too much barbeque sauce, but this was obviously not the case. The red onions and cilantro adds to it a wonderful extra kick, although I kinda wished for more cilantro. Very good pizza nonetheless. No wonder this is their most popular pizza!\n-Chicken Tequila Fettucine: also very delicious!! Chicken is very tender and sauce is creamy. This dish tastes 3x better when spraying lime all over the noodles, because due to the creamy texture you might feel a bit queasy (which can be quite alleviated by the limejuice!).\n-USC students get tax deducted!\n\nAlthough this particular CPK has a limited menu, they still carry the BBQ chicken AND the chicken fettucine, and therefore I am a fan. :)",

My lunch companion had the tomato, basil, mozarella pizza, and both the crust and cheese looked good (although the cherry tomatoes were halved rather than sliced so they slid off the pizza, and the basil appeared to have been cooked with the pizza rather than added after it came out of the oven).  He said it was fine, but probably not worth $8. \n\nThe lunch options within easy walking distance around this part of town are limited.  I was looking forward to another choice.  This place might be good for happy hour (the drink menu looked interesting) and I like the way they used the space.

It offers a comfortable, relaxed space with a friendly vibe -- the ceiling is a little low for the dough tossing though. A variety of pizzas are on display on the counter.  You buy by the slices and they will quickly re-bake your order. Their slices are very large (approx. two \"normal\" slices), but each slice costs ~$4 on average. I would have preferred smaller pieces at a lower price so that I can sample multiple flavors when I'm hungry or eat less when I'm not.\n\nPizza Sola makes NY-style pizzas; people who don't like doughy crusts will probably appreciate the thin crust. I like my crust more crispy so that it would hold its shape better, so I find Sola's a bit too floppy.  I like their sauce and cheese, and the topping proportion is reasonable. I find the vegetarian ones a bit on the bland side (they do offer a bunch of condiments like pepper flakes and garlic powder so you can doctor it up to your taste), but the meat pizza is satisfying.  \n\nGood soda selection -- black cherry, orange cream, root beer, etc.\n\nOverall, 3.5 stars for the entire venture, but an extra half star for opening in Oakland.",

Fresh and natural ingredients and the most flavorful chilies(i think?) i've ever had.

The dining in is not ideal. There are only a few tables in a small space that doesn't make this place inviting for people to come, sit, eat and enjoy.

                    "text": "I sort of feel bad for all the restaurants in the University District that don't receive the attention they deserve just because they're not on the Ave where people walking by see them all the time. MOD Pizza is one of those restaurants that I pass by all the time without really knowing it because the location is kind of hidden. It's behind Magus Bookstore, next to the ivy-covered wall. This restaurant is another nice addition to the countless places near UW that offer decent food at low prices. It's not a place I would visit if I were looking for a heavy, filling meal. But for a quick bite to eat, this place definitely gets the job done.\n\nI came to this place with a friend who wanted to come here because he had a coupon. That hardly seems necessary considering how inexpensive the meal is here. For $6.88 plus tax, you can get a MOD Pizza here. It's basically your own personalized pizza with toppings of your choice, and it serves just one person. MOD actually stands for \"Made on Demand,\" so that's a clever pun they have there. It reminds me of Subway almost, but you don't have quite as much freedom as you would at a buffet. You only get to tell the guy behind the counter what you want on the pizza, and he'll make it for you; you don't actually get to make the pizza yourself.\n\nBecause I have a tendency to get greedy at Subway and at buffets (I call it getting more bang for my buck), I asked the guy whether I could theoretically get every single topping on the pizza. He said that while it was technically possible, it also meant that I would also have to get less of every topping; it would have to all fit on there, so I might only get two olives, for instance. Instead, he recommended that I only get seven or eight toppings. Otherwise, apparently it wouldn't taste like anything because there's so much stuff on there at once. Uh... okay? I don't really see how that logic works, but I'm not the pizza expert, so I just took his advice.\n\nService was pretty quick. After making my order, they were able to put the toppings on the dough within a short amount of time. Really, the part that contributed most to the wait was the cooking of the pizza in the oven. Even then, it really didn't take that long. It just got placed in the oven with a few other pizzas and was done in a little over five minutes. From my perspective, the job didn't seem all that difficult, but again, I've only set foot in the restaurant once. After the pizza was done, it was taken out and the guy sliced it in four. He also spent a few moments inspecting it to make sure that all the toppings in the order were accounted for. I don't really see why this would be necessary after the pizza had already been made, but he explained that it was part of his job. Whatever.\n\nThe pizza is quite wide and actually appears to be a decent size. I don't know why only two olives would fit on there if everything else were also included in proportion, because it looks like there's plenty of room for everything. Oh well. I'm not one to argue with restaurant staff. The biggest problem with the pizza, though, is how thin it is. I didn't take a picture showing it, but the pizza is almost paper-thin. There's really no crust, either; the consistency is more or less the same throughout. And the dough after being cooked is crispy, which I found somewhat strange for a pizza. The vast majority of the pizza's substance (and flavor, for that matter) comes from whatever toppings you order, so it would be a good idea to choose wisely so as not to ruin the whole thing.\n\nThe good part is that the pizza actually does taste quite good. It's not very often that you come across a pizza that isn't good, so that may not seem like saying much. But when you consider that you're getting a fairly large platter of food for only around eight dollars, it doesn't seem so bad. However, you can get a much bigger and more filling pizza at Costco for just a few more dollars, so this one seems kind of disappointing in comparison. It's just so THIN that it's not really filling. I came here pretty hungry, and that didn't change much after I was done eating. I could have easily ordered a second one, but after thinking about how quickly the price would stack up, I decided against it. MOD Pizza is a great idea, but it feels just like light and quick snack food that doesn't really amount to a full meal. It's certainly not a bad place to visit, but I wouldn't come here expecting to be completely fed by just one pizza.",

Our sodas and salads were replenished at a decent rate, however they took a long time to bring out new pizzas, so we were sitting there for a while waiting...and the longer we waited the less hungry we got. Maybe that's their system, to make us wait a long time between the pizzas so that people eat less. The salad was ok, my soda was soda and I must say the pizza's were delicious. This is the order I would rate the pizzas, 1.Great white 2.buffalo chicken 3.bbq chicken 4.artichoke spinach.

That is pretty much the opposite of what someone wants when they order calamari. I mean come on! Fresh flavors of the sea. Or at least buy frozen squid and bread it yourself.\n\nNext we ordered a medium pie with sausage and sweet peppers. The cheese had that flat, white, unbrowned appearance of cafeteria pizza under a heat lamp. Rather than having large nuggest of sausage it was covered in tiny cylindrical pellets that, pardon my imagery, looked like mouse turds. The sweet peppers were an novel topping and helped the situation slightly. All in all this pizza was so bad and flavorless that we didn't bother with leftovers and you always take home extra pizza! The cashier saw us leave the pizza and was shocked we didn't want even want to take the leftovers. I think we hurt his feelings....\n\nI'm not sure what is more disappointing, the food or that this place had a 4 star Yelp rating.

Like Bertucci's type pizza, but with the soft crust. And it tasted good, about as good as Bertucci's. I tried one with onions and mushrooms and another with Bolognese sauce; both were good, neither fantastic. I also tried a little of a companion's salad (with gorgonzola and cherry tomatoes), which was very good, except had too much dressing on it (my companion had actually asked for dressing on the side; the waitress, remembering this, earnestly apologized for having forgotten to tell the kitchen).\n\nWhen they asked if we wanted to sit in the front or back, we first tried the back, which is by a big window overlooking the old cemetery. Nice view, but it was cold there, so we moved up front, which was better. The waitress said the heat is just inconsistent, and lets it get cold before it comes up and really heats the back, which was probably accurate.\n\nI was happy with Cambridge, 1. I'm not likely to go here again, because I can get better pizza at Uno's, Oggi, Crazy Dough's, a delivery place, or on a good day maybe Pinnochio's. But it was good food and atmosphere overall.

The crust is fantastic - it's very thick and chewy.  You get the feeling that it's made with real, quality ingredients (as opposed to that cardboard-y stuff you find at chain pizza places).  My particular favorites are the margherita and the Tucci's special (spicy shrimp and garlic - it's like scampi on a pizza!).  The prices for the pies are a bit higher than you'll pay at other places in the area, but I'm willing to splurge once in a while.\n\nI've also tried their pasta dishes and was less impressed with those.  I grew up in a Sicilian household where I was raised to take my sauce very seriously.  Tarantio's marinara and meat sauces are a bit too heavy on the tomato puree and don't have the depth that a real, quality pasta sauce should.  It's too tart and acidic. \n\nSome highlights on the menu apart from the pizzas are the garlic rolls (basically baked balls of pizza dough covered in garlic-infused olive oil) and the strombolis and calzones.  Anything that involves the Taranatino's pizza dough is good stuff in my book.\n\nIn terms of service, the staff is quite friendly but usually very busy too.  It's cash-only which makes me come here less often - buy a credit card reader, guys!  Parking is a limited in the area and quite a chore on Friday/Saturday nights, but its worth it in my opinion.",

I don't know why, especially when the great Tomatoes Apizza isn't all that far away, but that's just how it is.  You know something isn't quite right when Whole Foods is doing markedly better than most of the supposedly top-tier local places.\n\nThe good:  NYPD has delicious link-style sausage and carries fresh mozzarella.  If you haven't had fresh mozzarella on pizza, order it sometime and see why this is worth noting.  Oh, and the pies come in real sizes, like the 18\" large.  \n\nThe bad:  it's overpriced, consistently slightly under baked (though thankfully always cooked through), and they charge a huge delivery fee right on the top just for the pleasure of wanting some pizza.  This wouldn't be quite so bad if the delivery people weren't abysmal (when I order pizza, I expect it to be delivered, yet they would often call from the parking lot to ask me to come get it) and the fee wasn't $1 or more above most other places.\n\nThe bizarre:  They put \"NY\" right in the name, so one would expect some NY-style pizza, but that's not what you get.  Sure, it's thin enough and wide enough to fold over, but the crust is a pliant, elastic mess that more closely resembles play-doh than something out of the NYC.  \n\nSo why the three stars and why bother writing a review?  Because it's the best of a rather sorry bunch.  And when it's cooked well, which unfortunately is \"rarely,\" it's actually pretty enjoyable.  Once I resigned myself to having relatively bad pizza in an objectively poor crust, I even managed to crave it now and again.\n\nIf you're in Ann Arbor and you've simply got to eat pizza, NYPD is your answer despite the inflated price and uninspired flavors.  Since it will never have the satisfying NY-style texture anyway, you might as well pile it on.  My recommendation:  pepperoni, extra sausage, extra cheese, and fresh mozzarella.",

I hear stories from her about Millennium all the time, and we wanted to branch out and try another place that had a heavy focus on vegetarian food. We got the veggie charcuterie to start, and my friend and I split the cauliflower soup, hoping for something amazing. The soup was just lacking in flavor after we've had some of the most amazing cauliflower soup at Laurus in Blackhawk (closed now *sigh*). The charcuterie was okay, but not amazing. My husband got the Prather Ranch burger with fries and my friend and I split the Stinging Nettle Pizza. My husband said the burger was good. I tried the fries and, I have to say, those were some of the best fries I've ever had. I think I liked them because they were on the salty side and I love salt. Pizza was good, I especially liked the blistered crust. Overall I just wasn't blown away. I was impressed by the dedication to the food and the fact that our server knew exactly what heirloom variety of broccoli flown in from France was in our appetizer. Gotta love that kind of passion. Only hiccup of the evening was our server put in the wrong pizza order. The manager just happened to bring our food to us and set down the pizza and said \"Fontinella Pizza\" and my friend and I both shouted out \"No!\". We told her we ordered the Stinging Nettle Pizza. She apologized and went to find out what the trouble was. She came back and apologized again and said that they were rushing our pizza for us and would take it off the bill. Then our server came over and apologized. It was the most gracious admission of error I've ever seen in my life and I totally appreciated it. They really deserve another star just for customer service.",

(Where you'd think there would be foodies around to appreciate \"artisan\" pizza).\n\nTurns out we were wrong.\n\nWe started out with the \"garlicy\" prawn appetizer.  I guess I should have read the description more carefully in the menu.  What showed up was a piece of garlic bread with some shrimp on top, all slathered in a very basic tomato sauce.  This is the kind of thing that you could expect at a really low-end \"family\" restaurant, next to a big platter of eggplant parm, dripping in cheap cheese.  I kind of couldn't believe it.  Artisan?\n\nNext up was the fennel sausage and brocoli rabe pizza.  Sounds good, doesn't it?  Sounds like artisan pizza.  Sadly, no.  For this pizza to rise above standard, the sausage really needs to contribute more flavor than salt.  It was nice to have the rabe on the pizza because it made me feel healthier I guess, but the whole thing just didn't come together.  The sauce tasted like the same stuff drowning the \"garlicy\" shrimp.  It was really basic, like if I took a can of tomato sauce from Trader Joes and pressed a couple of garlic cloves in.  (I make pizzas at home, so, yeah.)\n\nHere's the rub: in the Feb 2010 issue of Sunset magazine (which has its HQ in Menlo, so they could have actually come over and sampled this place) ranks Howie's as one of the top 10 pizza places in the Bay Area.

I stopped by today after a recommendation from a friend and I couldn't be any happier. I haven't had NY style pizza like this anywhere in DC - tasty crust, delicious sauce, and cheese melted just right - nice and hot out of the oven :) Who could ask for more? And I didn't have to. As I was raving about how much I was enjoying the cheese pizza Vito himself brought over a slice of his Vodka Sauce pizza. Oh. My. Wow. The vodka sauce is his own recipe and the ratio of sauce to cheese is so perfect, that it's a rich pizza but not overly rich like other places. I'll definitely be back to try some of his other pizzas and other menu items and I can't wait until he expands his place - it's going to be busy but well worth it! \n\nVito himself is also a great guy - he greets every customer as they walk in, knows familiar faces, and is just so hospitable. It was refreshing to see an owner who cares so much about his business and is so involved. Another thing I love is his graffiti wall in the back - he even said I could paint on there so I plan on going back next week to take him up on it! What a way to get your guests to interact and have fun while enjoying some yummy pizza. \n\nEven if you aren't in the College Park area but craving NY style pizza, I encourage you to stop by Vito's.

I went in on a Monday night, just after the line subsided, and was pretty impressed with the interior.  At first glance, the food prep area looked pretty nice.  The Wood Pizza Peels were stacked, ready to be used, and the Pizza was prepared fresh to order That, however, is as far as my happiness with this place went.  \n\nWhen I approached the counter there were 5 or 6 employees congregating behind the counter at the pizza station.  It took almost 2 minutes for them to even acknowledge that I was ready to order, and when I did, it took another minute or so for them to get ready to take my order.  I can only imagine how slowly this unorganized assembly line takes when there is a line.  \n\nAs far as the Pizza goes, it's just ok.  The crust is a little salty, and the crust got so soggy that eating required a fork.  I suppose it doesn't help that I chose mushrooms and olives, both of which, unbeknownst to me, were drenched in oil (the mushrooms were marinated, and the olives were of the oily kalamata style variety. The flavor was ok, but I really was disappointed at how thin and soggy the crust got in the center of the pizza.  I understand that it should be a little soggy, but this was ridiculous....To be fair, I may give them another shot and tell them to make it crispy. The gorgonzola salad was pretty tasty though.\n\nNow, I'm not claiming to be an expert on pizza, but having eaten pizza all over the world, including all over Italy, New York, Chicago, parts of Asia, and beyond, I think this place is more hype than anything else.  Do they have a cool concept...yes, but its disorganized, and food-wise, there is definitely better in LA, but for the money, Its not bad.",

Pretty expensive averaging $20 for a small/medium pizza in the menu. They didn't have much of a selection..heck, there was no selection....of beverages. That's probably why everyone brought their own wine and beer...although the door had a sign, \"No Outside Drinks\". Don't ask...\n\nYou place your order, they write a number on your receipt, then you walk to the cooking kitchen in the back, grab a seat (if you can...if you're not into communal seating...find a corner to munch down your pizza)...wait till your number is called (if you could hear it through all the screaming as everyone is attempting to have a conversation over one another) and have your pizza brought to you.\n\nThe bad...so bad...don't bring anyone here for a conversation. The place is drowning with college students and the ones that just can't seem to let go of their college years in fear of growing up. Lots of screaming as everyone is trying to scream above everyone else to be heard..and those that just love to scream.\n\nI couldn't get my food down any faster and get the heck out. So I boxed whatever pizza was left, got up to get some more parmasan cheese to go (mind you...10ft. away)...and my box of leftover pizza was gone and there sits another set of roudy wanna-be-in-college-again-twenty-somethings.\n\nAs I said, the pizza was good...but next time, it's an order to go where I can sit and enjoy the evening with friends, nice conversation over a bottle of wine... in the peace of my backyard!",

Time and maturity changes things;  it felt like a journey before, now it just feels like a trip down the street.  What hasn't changed, is how bloody good this pizza is.\n\nI am not from New York, and I don't think I ACTUALLY have a grasp on what their style pizza tastes like.  Yes, I've been to New York for a few days; tried Lombardi's and didn't like it.  I preferred all the hole in the wall places I would just pass by on the way to my destinations.  That's right, dirty, greasy, hole in the wall pizza.  That's the way I like it, and that's the way that Lamonica's serves it up.\n\nThe establishment isn't on any grand scale.  Inside it's decorated like a NY subway station, the furniture has never changed all the years that I've been going, they don't have a public restroom, parking sucks and they only take cash.  One wall is adorned with pictures of celebrities that have visited Lamonica's.  The other has a cheesy (no pun intended) mural painted like the inside of a subway station, with more celebrity likenesses.  Sounds a bit underwhelming right?  Yeah, nothing to write home about.  The real reason you came is for the pizza.\n\nThe pizza is precooked.  When you order it, they toss it back in the oven to heat it back up, then it's thrown onto a pizza pan and given to you.  You take it, put whatever condiments you want on it, and then you dispose of it.  It's just simply the best pizza I've ever had in my life.  I don't know what else I can say about it.  Don't expect anything fancy and healthy (i.e. not greasy), if so you're looking at the wrong place; hell, you're in the wrong hemisphere.",

I looked forward to it and talked it up to the hubby for two days straight; the reviews and pictures had me hoping for an excellent pie a la Gialina, our previous favorite.\n\nAt 5:45 the place was already busy with young families and couples. We could have waited for a table, but we sat at the bar right away. All the better, we love sitting at the bar.\n\nWe ordered two glasses of wine, very pleased with both. Howie's knows how to provide good and inexpensive red wine to pair with pizza. Even the house red- \"Howie's Red\"- was really good. We shared a Caesar salad to start. The romaine was crisp and fresh, the dressing lightly coated the leaves without drenching. \n\nBut oh, the pizza. Please note, the online menu does not reflect the reality exactly. We tried two of the offerings on the menu, split on one pie: the house-made sausage with broccoli rabe, and the pizza bianco. It came piping hot on an elevated trivet, and we dug right in.\n\nThe crust is so good. It's funny how pizza crust can make or break, as it should be so fantastic but not overpower the toppings. Broccoli rabe is a wonderful topping for pizza, and the pizza bianco had such wonderful flavor from the plethora of cheeses. If I remember correctly, it was topped with mozzarella, parmesan, smoked mozzarella, and housemade ricotta. I may be omitting one or two. It was also topped with fresh chopped scallions, and with a little added red pepper flakes it was divine. We didn't leave any behind.\n\nI am so happy to say that we will be back again and again... very soon. Palo Alto is a much easier drive from San Mateo than Glen Park, and I can't wait to try some of Howie's other pies. We'll be back at the bar to sample other pies soon.",

Rude. \n\nThey were also rude to me when I asked about dressing or what salad was the best... um hello. this is where you work. you should be able to give a suggestion other than 'they are all good'. \n\nIf you can deal with a little snip with your delicious food this is your kinda place.",

Since they've been together for only a little while, they're in that cute phase where he wants to take her to all of his old haunts, and Mama Palma's was one of them. Since we wanted to see one another, he suggested getting dinner there and I wasn't about to suggest an alternative (hard not to - so many good places in the area I still haven't tried!). \n\nWe didn't make reservations, so it was good that when we arrived on a Saturday evening there was a table available. Once we sat down, the place filled up pretty quickly as high dinner hour arrived. We perused the menu before the couples decided to share dishes - because we're cute like that. They shared a garden salad and each got small pizzas; my friend had the Brunella (asparagus tips, baby zucchini, plum tomatoes, on our garlic herb sauce. topped with mozzarella cheese, garnishes with basil) and her bf made his own pizza with shrimp, onions and spinach. My bf and I shared a roasted veggie appetizer plate they had on special, and split an Herbed Sausage and Artichoke Hearts pizza (two kinds of roasted herbed sausages, artichoke hearts, mozzarella and romano cheeses, on our own red sauce garnished with cilantro). The roasted veggies were great, LOTS of garlic roasted with them, but our pizza could've been better. It had a great thin crust, but my bf complained about the cheese (I asked for low fat, which clearly isn't to his liking) and the sauce we all agreed was bland and tasteless. Their garden salad was gigantic and filled with fresh ingredients, and while they enjoyed their pizzas they agreed with our overall assessment. However, we had a lovely time together and had a very nice server that evening who was quite attentive. Glad they have an ATM there because it's cash only (which seems really silly given how expensive their pizzas are). Mama Palma's would be better if they accepted credit AND they at least made a better pizza sauce recipe, because the topping combinations are great! But if you can't make a good pizza sauce, well, you can't make a damn fine pizza!",

Fresh San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzerella, and a perfectly thin and crisp but chewy crust (they also sell the dough for $3.75/lb, which I'll get once we get a replacement tile for our oven).  The crust with sauce made from Jersey Fresh tomatoes would be divine, so I can't wait.  Maybe I can even try to make it on the grill.  So many possibilities now that I know I can get some great dough.\n\nI've heard that the slices are so-so, but I really don't mind calling, being told it will be ready in 15 minutes, and walking straight out the door to pick it up.  It is so good.\n\nAccording to their flyer, they DO deliver, but that's really not an issue for us.  \n\n$22 including tax for a large pepperoni and garlic pizza ($18 for pepperoni only), from which the 2 of us devoured all but 2 slices, which then made for an incredible lunch the next day.  I can't believe that I'm actually starting to like pepperoni, but from my recent foray into such great pizzas with REAL pepperoni, I may be a convert.\n\nThis might be a better crust than Sotto's, which says a lot.\n\nUpdate 8/4/09\nAfter months of incredible pizza, tonight I was disappointed.  The crust was thicker in parts and doughy at the edge, the sauce wasn't crushed tomatoes but puree, and it was really salty.  Maybe the mozzerella was different?  My mouth still hurts.  \n\nSince I have a healthy basil plant growing, as well as great tomato sauce and fresh mozzerella, I'll pick up a pound of dough and make it myself next time.  \n\nWhy a 4 and not lower?  We've had at least 8 great pizzas in a row and tonight's was the only doozie.  Delivery is prompt (we ordered at 9:15, it arrived at 9:40).  I would, however, warn against the antipasto; it was simply bad.  \n\nHours: Monday-Saturday 11-10; Sunday 4-9:30\n\nUPDATE 10/13/09: I downgraded them to a 2 and it's doubtful I'll order another pizza from them.\n\nThis pizza was just as bad as last time, only now there's even less basil.  WTF?  Really?  This place went from having a perfectly crisp and chewy crust with tasty sauce and generous amounts of basil to a doughy, tasteless mush that even our pizza stone and generous dousings of spices couldn't save.  And each slice of pepperoni had a 1/4-1/2\" pool of grease.  \n\nIf Pizza Star were Pepsi, Old World has decided to create New Coke.",

The pizzas are large, thin-crust crunchy delicious circles of goodness.  There is a huge list of pre-set pizzas to choose from, or if you are really picky like me you can choose from about 30 toppings to create your own.  My personal favorite combo is the basil, mushroom, broccoli, tomato and buffalo mozerella pie. \n\nIf for some odd reason you feel the need to make this meal a bit healthier, you can opt for a whole wheat crust (DONT recommend) or one of their yummy salads. The greek is my fav--don't know what is in that dressing but I'm pretty sure it's crack. I love it. \n\nWould have given them 5 stars but for the price--but it's definitely worth it.",

I didn't since the host told me that the one pizza could be shared by two people which is not true. Only one size;10inches(6 slices). The wait is long,30 minutes to get the food served.\n\nOverall, a great place near a shopping center, outside seating for those who want to  enjoy the weather and dog friendly.",

                    "text": "Grand Opening Review:\nDisclaimer:  Obviously with any new restaurant there are \"growing pains.\"  Some worse than others, so this review may be subject to change.  \n\nAtmosphere:  4 Stars.  \nHuge place with lots of well placed seating.  TVs and one large projection monitor showing sports on Dish Network.  Great for big games!  Buffet line gets a little packed and disorderly however, and rampant cutting by rowdy undergrads can be off-putting.\n\nFood: \n1 Star for Quantity:\nEven accounting for the high volume of customers inevitably drawn to a grand opening in a campus location, the quantity of the pizza and pasta available was extremely disappointing. Only one pizza was out on the buffet every 5-10 minutes, and scores of Somalia-starved students pushed and shoved their way to take 2 or 3 slices for themselves.  Less like a \"buffet\" and more like a \"fishing expedition.\"  IF I end up eating here again on a less \"momentous\" night, this rating will probably go up.  \n\n3 Stars for Quality/Variety; \nThe pizzas were not bad, somewhere between Papa Johns and Pizza Hut.  For the price of $7 I would say it's decent value (however see above on quantity).  Dough of the pizza was actually good, and I found myself eating the crust (which I rarely do)...but this might be cause I had nothing else to do while waiting in line for more pizzas to come out.  Variety of the pizza toppings ranged from Macaroni & Cheese (wtf?) to some Pesto/Mint Chicken (not bad) to BBQ Chicken (didn't get to try ;() to DESSERT S'Mores (didn't try, but my friend LOVED it @_@).  PASTA was undercooked, and consisted of plain penne or spaghetti with your choice of cream or marina sauce to pour over.  SALAD bar is well stocked with many different toppings and a surprisingly gourmet-ish variety of dressings.  SOUPS (chicken noodle, chicken tortilla) were a little salty, but maybe because I only had the last few scoops of the pot.  There's also soft-serve ICE CREAM in vanilla and chocolate which was actually pretty good.  Lots of SODA (free with buffet), which I miserably tried to make an ice cream float with.  \n\nService: 5 Stars.\nOne thing's for sure, their staff did a great job on Grand Opening night.  Constantly bussing and clearing dirty trays and dishes.  Even though all I had were empty plates at my table (from unsuccessful trips to get the elusive Pizza), it seemed every 10 minutes someone came by to pick them up LOL.  Cashiers were very friendly as well.  The girl manning the buffet line also seemed courteous and looked like she felt extremely sympathetic at the unwashed masses of hungry kids waiting for their next slice of pizza. +1 for Caring. \n\nValue and Appeal: 3 Stars\n$7 for Pizza Buffet which includes AYCE pizza, salad, (limited pasta), soda and ice cream seems to be a good deal if you're a \"volume eater\"--which I'm not.  \n\nIn the context of Berkeley eateries, this place is definitely DIFFERENT.  Has a chain-restaurant processed feel to it but the potential for success if they improve on weaknesses.  I think it's a nice change from the usual small-scale mom and pop feel and adds something (though I'm not quite sure just what) to our local cuisine options (which are dominated by Thai, Indian, Japanese, Middle-Eastern food and yes, Pizza).",

We ordered the meat lovers on the wheat crust (kind of ironic isn't it) and I have to say it was probably some of the best pizza I have had. It was just the right blend of toppings and cheese and sauce. \n\nThe actual restaurant is a bit on the small side and only has maybe 6 tables. You can definitely tell that their main customer is delivery. The atmosphere of the place is very 70's/80's, Lots of fantasy pictures of vikings, warriors, barbarians, etc. and of course you gotta love the wood paneling. Take a look at a few of the pictures on the website. Its like walking back in time.\n\nOverall Conan's has some great pizza and while the dine in experience hurts its rating, I would definitely order delivery from them in the future.",

                    "text": "I'd been itching to try Howie's ever since I noticed this new spot in the increasingly upgraded Town and Country Shopping Center. (Wow--they've really done a lot here in the last few years, no?) I'm a big fan of flat, artisan pizzas and was eager to see what twist Howie's had on the concept. It seemed like every time I was in the area with a hankering for pizza, I was either on my way to or coming from Pizza Antica in San Jose, so I kept saying to myself \"next time, Raul, next time you *will* try Howie's!\" Well two weeks ago, I finally took the plunge.\n\nI was pretty hungry after a lackluster lunch, so I ordered the polenta to start, then the baked potato pizza (with thinly sliced potatoes, bacon and cheese). The polenta was pretty bland--and while the polenta arrived piping hot, the accompanying sauce was ice cold. Total buzzkill! (And speaking of the sauce, I've had better sauces from a jar at the grocery store.) I was a little worried how the pizza was going to turn out if the appetizer was any indication . . .\n\nWell, sadly, the pizza didn't impress me. First off, the crust was pretty thick, in my opinion, for artisan pizza. I had expected a delicate, crispy crust--what arrived certainly wasn't deep-dish, but it was a little thicker than I'd expected. The potatoes didn't have much flavor and the bacon tasted like cheap microwave-ready bacon, not the gourmet bacon I had been expecting. I think if they'd invested in better quality ingredients--maybe an applewood-smoked bacon, some caramelized onions and truffle oil, for instance--this could have been a delicious pizza, actually. Considering the prices they're charging for their pizzas, I think they should splurge on better ingredients.\n\nWe must have gotten here right before the dinnertime rush because we were seated right away, pretty surprising given I've always seen a line at this small, but popular, dinner spot. Our service was a little hit or miss--a little brusque at times, I think because of the line of people waiting for a table and a desire to get diners in and out quickly. I will say, our food did arrive pretty quickly, always a welcome sign at a restaurant. The atmosphere inside was a little strange--a little too industrial. And wow, it gets loud inside--there's no sound dampening on the walls or ceiling and when the restaurant is full of families (and screaming kids) around dinnertime, it's pretty noisy.\n\nI think other restaurants, like Pizza Antica in San Jose or Hot Italian in Sacramento, certainly have a better handle on the artisan pizzeria concept. They've got a better attention to detail--like choosing high-quality ingredients and handling the burgeoning crowds--that Howie's is missing. \n\nI haven't written Howie's off entirely, mind you. I'm still sold on the artisan pizzeria and the menu piqued my curiosity. I think we just made a poor choice while ordering. I mean, in all fairness, we were warned by the table next to us that the baked potato pizza wasn't anything special, but we decided to try it anyway. Maybe the other simpler pizzas, like pepperoni or margherita, might be tastier?",

Truly delicious. \n\nThe second was a meat extravaganza, bacon, ham, sausage, pepperoni, grilled chicken and more. Equally delicious.  \n\nI love a good thin crust pizza but this seems to lack a bit of chew to it that would make this a 5 star pizza instead of 4 star.

I'm a student! I'm broke, don't do that to me! Think of how much alcohol that could have bought me at a bar! lol. Seriously though, spending approx. 20$ a pizza is too much. \n\nAlso, they no longer serve Smirnoff ice. I know I suck for liking that stuff, but I do! So I miss it. They also no longer serve a hard cider. So you're stuck with beer or beer. And I think they have wine still, but I honestly didn't check. Try the beer with the Orange Slice dude that looks like a deformed Raisenette on top of it...It's pretty light and \"fruity\" hehe, the \"breakfast beer\" as the guy called it. \n\nThey do deliver on campus so that is pretty cool. And they definitely have alcohol and us students appreciate that. It's usually pretty quiet and empty even though it's in Price Center (I mean at the lunch rush there's a line, but once that disperses you're good).

We had the San Gennaro and it was out of this world.  Sausage was tasty and flavorful, peppers were bursting with flavor, bufala you could only imagine. Since the pizza is so fresh, you don't feel stuffed and bloated when you're done with it.  They don't serve beer or wine but I've heard you can bring them in, not sure about the corkage fee though.  And the cannolis - you can't leave without trying one.  We bought the vanilla with chocolate chip, pistachio, and chocolate.  Chocolate was too rich; pistachio was very good but I think the chocolate chip was my favorite.   Wish I had an Antico in DC!",

We always get garlic sauce with our order and they are 100% consistent at forgetting it in the order, even though it is written on the pizza box. \n\nParking leaves everything to be desired. They have several spots in front of the store, but you have to back out straight onto Kirby, not an easy feat. The better spots are actually on the side street or in the Starbuck's parking lot.\n\nBefore you order check retailmenot.com or couponcabin.com they always have working discounts for Dominos.",

The Sicilian pizza is heavenly and cheap.  Two thick, square, deep-dish pieces for under $5.  The owners and staff are fun, and if you make an effort to put away your cell phone while you order, they will smile and be nice to you.  If you ignore them, they'll basically ignore you.  Seems fair to me.  The owner once told me that the best selling pizzas are: Tomato-Basil, Pepperoni and Cheese.  Those three types add to 90% of the business.  Don't bother with the flat bread pizza, though I hear the subs are pretty good.  It's a hole-in-the-wall restaurant in the truest sense:  broken pavement on the road, uneven steps leading to the door, piles of cardboard boxes in the alley, but the Sicilian pizza is amazing.  More of a \"I missed dinner\" or \"It's 1am and I'm famished\" place than a first date or family place.",

White - A bed of fresh spinach, topped with ricotta and mozzarella cheeses on a rosemary garlic olive oil sauce. 14\" - $14.45: NOT BAD at all. Lots of ricotta cheese and the crust was nice and thin.\n\n2.  Master - Pepperoni, sausage, green peppers, mushrooms, and onions. Small - $17.45. This was a deep dish pizza that my friends really liked. It could feed 3 ppl easily. \n\nIn the past, we also tried:\n\n3. Fried Zucchini : Yuck. I'm sure it's good when it's right out of the fryer. But when it's delivered, yeah, not so much...\n\n4, Greek Salad: nothing that interesting. Simple salad.\n\nSo bottom line, not bad. The pizzas last Sat were delivered nice and hot so that's awesome. Just make sure you call them plenty of time in advance b/c it generally takes about 1.25 hrs for delivery!",

I've had better cheaper pizza at cheeseboard. \n\nThe burger was small, and not seasoned well. The bread they used however was excellent. This and medium rare, was indeed medium rare. The fries are bad. Definitely on the overcooked. Fries off the dollar menu at McDonalds are better in my opinion. $14. \n\nHalf chicken. Seemed more like 1/8 of a chicken. Really small portion, and not very flavorful. Definitely did not justify the price. $23\n\nI wouldn't go on to recommend Gather for the cost, the quality, and the atmosphere (much too loud - seems like a grand Applebees more than anything).\n\nFor $71 after tax and tip, there are much better eats.",

My friend and I split a marinara pizza with chicken, eggplant, artichoke, and ricotta cheese, since we had already eaten a little beforehand.  \n\nWhat makes this place unique is that you pretty much build your own pizza, they also have specialty pies, which are already made combinations of toppings.  If you have been to Pieology in Fullerton its the same concept.  The service was friendly and fast.  We got our pizza about a minute after we paid at the cashier.  The only problem was that there were no tables to sit at!!  We awkwardly waited around people who seemed to be finished so we could quickly take their table.  \n\nOther than that the pizza was really good!  It's neopolitan style, so its soft crust and a little hard to eat since its soooo soft.  I would recommend eating it with a knife and fork!  Probably will come again, prices are very reasonable and all the ingredients seem really fresh!",

Not only do they have great beer, the food is also excellent. \n\nWe started the night with some of their $1 spent grain bread. This is probably one of my favorite things here. It comes fresh out of the oven, all warm and wrapped in a napkin. The bread is made from the spent grains used in making the beers that they serve here. It has grains on top and is really a delicious hearty bread. \n\nFor dinner I had the Asparagus Mushroom Pizza. This is my staple when I go here. It is a thin crispy flat bread pizza with mushrooms, asparagus, and ricotta cheese on top. It is absolutely to die for. I am somewhat of a pizza snob coming from Chicago, so when I have pizza I have high expectations. This is by far one of my favorites in Atlanta. It is just thin and crispy enough for me with extremely flavorful fresh ingredients. \n\nI also tried a few of their beers while I was there. I was in a dark beer mood so I had the Thor and the Dar Star Stout. Both were quite good. My favorite of the night was the Thor tho, because it was extremely dark, smooth, and had a hint of sweetness to it. \n\nOverall a great experience as always. Friendly staff, good food, great beer, and just a great time.",

Like some other reviewers say, the menu doesn't make their food sound that exciting, but the photos really do them justice. \n\nI ate here on a brunch weekend and we ordered:\n\nPrather Ranch Burger - We got it medium rare and it was perfection. The burger was juicy and full of flavors. The cheese was melted perfectly and the red onions added a bit of a crunch. \n\nThe Burger Plate Cons: I'm not a fan of the side salad with olive oil. I kind of just feel like I'm eating oily leaves with no flavor. And their house ketchup tasted more like a slightly sweet spaghetti + salsa which wasn't what I was expecting.\n\nEgg Pizza with Bacon, Caramelized Onion, and Oregano -  The perfect pizza! Almost better than Cheeseboard and as sacrilegious of a statement that is, it might be because I'm a meat lover and this pizza has tasty bacon. The egg also really complemented the pizza and made it more brunch appropriate. The other part that I really loved was the crust. They have billowy pockets of air which makes the inside of the crust so soft and tasty. As a kid, that was always my favorite part of the crust and Gather has really perfected it.\n\nI love this place!",

Yes, I can confirm that it is the same Brownstone that can be found on Colorado in Eagle Rock next to Colorado Wine Company.  In fact, it should be exactly the same, since the chef from Eagle Chef location is now head chef at the Pasadena location.   We saw this location appear just last week after TT Seafood went under and have been chopping at t he bit to try.  \n\nSo pizza does require a huge drawn out description.  Purists will say that its NOT \"New York Style\"  but I counter with the fact that you will be hard pressed to find true New York Style Pizza outside of NYC.  This is about as close as I've found in So Cal.  Not too much cheese, a nice balance between the cheese and the sauce.  Sauce, which you could actually taste.  We got mushrooms and sausage on our pie.  The sausage was good quality and the mushrooms were fresh (as opposed to the beloved Casa Bianca in Eagle Rock).  We were the only customers at the time (hey, they just opened), but the staff was friendly and talkative and our pizza came out promptly.  It's a damn good pizza, and just about the best bet for delivery in Pasadena.\n\nDelivery starts Tuesday, Jan 13th",

Five Dollars! Can you believe it? It's a Monday special from 6 to 8 p.m. when Oggi sells a large pizza for a mere $5. We ordered it without cheese (cheeseless pizza!) and extra sauce. \n\nWhen the pizza came out, though, I was a bit disappointed. The crust did NOT have sesame seeds and it wasn't doughy at all, but full of air. We paid an additional $2.50 for extra sauce, but there were still empty spots without any sauce on the dough. The name \"Tomato, Basil, and Garlic\" is somewhat of a misnomer because the only tomato I tasted was from the marinar sauce, there was only a few leaf of basil, and no taste of garlic whatsoever. I did like that the crust was very thin and not very greasy or oily. The biggest disappointment was definitely the crust. Oh well.",

After we ask for bread, she then forgets to bring the bread...twice! Down to 10% tip. \n\nShe did, however, have the brightest smile and a gorgeous attitude. So ergo...we gave her 15% tip. I sold out. \n\nAs for the food: The Works pizza is no good. It's like paying 13 dollars for a supreme pizza I can get at Costco for 5 dollars cheaper. The Santa Fe and Mango Tandoori are keepers, while the White pizza is great if you love cheese. The Jambalaya is good if you're willing to fork over 15+ for it. \n\nMy rating is a little bias since I could make pasta at home for 4 bucks.

The food is aiite. Wish they were open a bit later.

It's sort of a faux-NY style pizza (relatively thin crust with slices that you have to fold in half and optionally let the grease drain out of).  For just a slice or two with some toppings, the price feels a little bit on the higher side, but it's still not bank-breaking.  The \"meaty\" slice at lunch is a pretty good deal because, at least for the slice I got, they really loaded it up with plenty of dead animals... pretty good bang for the buck for the carnivores out there.  Another plus is that adding garlic to your slice gets you real, authentic, non-roasted, don't-go-kissing-anyone garlic (grab a breath mint on your way out).  Anyway, it's not the best pizza I've had, but it makes for a decent occasional lunch.\n\n(Note on waiter service info: They don't have regular waiter service, at least at lunch.  You just order at the counter, they give you a table-number-thing, and then someone brings you your pizza when it's ready.)",

It's just okay pizza.\n\nThe last time I was there, it was about 1 am, and all I wanted was a regular cheese slice. Sounds like a simple enough request, right? Apparently not. The person at the counter gruffly informed us that there were no plain cheese slices available. Upon asking how long we would have to wait for one, an answer of 45 minutes was given. What?! Are you kidding me?! Granted, they were quite busy and dealing with the Saturday late night rush, but seriously?! What pizza place doesn't have a plain cheese slice readily available?! Nevertheless, we ordered what they did have available: spinach sicilian slices and mushroom sicilian slices. To my further dismay, when I bit into the slices (literally 2 minutes after buying them), they were cold.\n\nI'm not a fan.",

Maybe it's the New Yorker in me, but this place really seems pretty mediocre--I've gotten pizzas fresh, I've come at different times, I've tried multiple kinds of pizzas...and never have I really been impressed. I've been to super-cheap ratty places in Long Island and Brooklyn that've left more of an impression on me than this joint. I've picked burnt pieces and hair off tastier slices than theirs. This and Crazy Dough's seem like places with a lot of hype but not much flavor. The only reason I'd go back to Pinnochio's is because it's often open later than most places in Harvard Square.\n\nTip for anyone looking for good pizza in the area: try the Upper Crust--a bit more pricey, but definitely tastier and more consistent. Bertucci's is also pretty good, but of course it's not in the same class (being more of a sit-down restaurant rather than a pizzeria). Some of the pricier pizzas at Cinderella's are also pretty decent.",

Whenever I want to have a nice dinner out without breaking the bank, my friends and I inevitably gravitate towards Teresa's charming, friendly, and totally delicious pastas & pizzas. They have two kitchens -- one open where they make all of their pizza, and another in back where they handle all of the other foods.\n\nIf I'm feeling broke, I usually go for the pizzas as they are definitely on a lower price spectrum than the pastas. The pizzas ($9 - $13) are thin beauties with a slightly chewy crust with fresh, high-quality toppings. Sometimes I wish the crust were slightly charred a la Old World, but that is more a personal preference. :)\n\nUsually though, I go straight for the pastas ($12 - $18). My favorite is the Conchiglie Balsamico, a deliciously creamy dish (with a tang!) of shell-shaped pasta with slivers of asparagus and tender chicken. It's a dish with innovative flavors, though the sauce may not appeal to everyone (I suggested it once to my mom's friend who wasn't a fan, but everyone else I know has liked it...) I also like the Linguine Vongole and Penne all'Arrabbiata, with more straightforward flavors, but cooked very well none the less. They also like to use organic ingredients, so don't be surprised if you see \"Raised Right chicken\" or \"Simply Grazin' beef\". I think it's a little snobby, but the names themselves are pretty humorous in and of themselves.\n\nAlso, if you like nutella, the dessert pizza is yummm. Sure, conceptually, the dish is ridiculously simple, but can you make a pizza crust like Teresa can? No, probably not.\n\nIn short, while in NY, I would probably rate Teresa's a solid 4, this is really as good as it gets (without breaking the bank) at Princeton.",

Always crowded at dinner, you will probably have to wait for a table; but the atmosphere is friendly and the place has a funky feel to it.

They do a few variations on the usual flat pizza, e.g. rolling it up or making a stromboli, and the range of toppings goes beyond the typical Domino-Hut-Pappa's fare.  The two kids working there seemed pretty bored, and the place was empty when I strolled in around 6 pm on a Wednesday, but if you want the most casual of tasty, brick oven pizzerias (and if you can find it tucked away behind Home Depot), check the place out.  It's nestled deep in a strip mall within a huge strip mall complex.",

The play was good the actors were great, but it's definitely a thinking kinda show.\n\nThat said - yeah...don't let the fact that it's under a pizza joint and the fact that you can eat pizza and beer make you think that this isn't a serious place.  It is.  It's very intimate and you're going to be close to the show.  Closer, even, than you are at the Aurora theater.  Which is good - especially since the actors are so good.",
